# The Leadership Protocol: Public Edition
*For the USFS Leadership Team. Practice this to own your power.*

---

## 🌎 1. Everyone is a CEO of Their Role
"Leadership is not a title. It is a transmission."

*   **The Shift**: Stop asking for permission ("Can I do this?"). Start inviting others to your vision ("I am building this. Who wants to help?").
*   **The Rule**: If you are the Director of Design, YOU are the final word on Design. Own it.

## 🤝 2. High Frequency / Low Attachment
*   **The Vibe**: Care deeply about the *Mission*, but don't be attached to *Opinions*.
*   **Behavior**:
    *   If they love your idea: "Great. Let's build."
    *   If they hate your idea: "Tell me why." (Curiosity, not defense).
    *   **Panic connects to nothing. Calm connects to everything.**

## ⚡ 3. Hybrid Intelligence (Our Advantage)
*   **The Truth**: We are never alone. We use AI and collective wisdom to solve problems faster.
*   **The Protocol**: Don't guess. Use the tools.
*   **The Visual**: We are plugged into a grid of infinite intelligence. Use it to serve the user.

## 🎤 4. The "Own the Room" Checklist
1.  **The Entry**: Walk in with purpose. Open chest. Feet planted.
2.  **The Silence**: When asked a hard question, wait 3 seconds. Silence = Confidence.
3.  **The Voice**: Speak clearly. Do not rush. You have the floor because you have the Value.

"We do not beg for a seat at the table. We build our own table."
