## 1. HELIX / Grant Evaluators

**Goal:** Get the money. Keep it simple.

**Script:**
> "I'm DJ. I built SDG Passport - a gamified platform that tracks student sustainability actions and feeds data directly into AASHE STARS reporting. We're the official platform for USFS club at Seneca, and we're partnering with Responsible Cafes TO to track real-world behavior change. The grant goes to SDG Innovation Labs, a non-profit I'm incorporating. CSJ will fund our program staff."

## 2. Potential Partners (Responsible Cafes, etc.)

**Goal:** Show mutual value. Be collaborative.

**Script:**
> "I'm building SDG Passport - we gamify sustainability actions for students. Your initiative is proven (40% cup reduction), mine is the tracking layer. Together, students earn points for using reusable cups, you get real impact data, I get user engagement. No money changes hands - just mutual benefit. Want to pilot at 3 cafés near Seneca?"

## 3. Board Members (Future)

**Goal:** Show you understand governance. Be transparent.

**Script:**
> "SDG Innovation Labs is the non-profit that operates the SDG Passport program. Agape Home Inc. - my personal for-profit - owns the software IP and licenses it to the non-profit. I recuse from any vote involving Agape. CSJ-funded students do program work only - workshops, community engagement. They never touch code. The code is built by me or Agape-contracted developers. This keeps the audit trail clean."

| Mention | Yes/No |
|---------|:------:|
| SDG Labs | ✅ |
| Agape | ✅ |
| IP structure | ✅ |
| Recusal | ✅ |

## 4. CRA / Auditors (If Asked)

**Goal:** Show separation. Be precise.

**Script:**
> "SDG Innovation Labs is a federal non-profit. It operates the SDG Passport program and employs CSJ-funded students for community engagement work. Agape Home Inc. is a separate for-profit corporation I own. SDG Labs licenses software from Agape at arm's length pricing, approved by board resolution with my recusal documented. The entities have separate bank accounts, separate purposes, and no shared employees."

**Key phrases:** Arm's length, board resolution, recusal, separate purposes

| Mention | Yes/No |

| Both entities | ✅ |
| Separation | ✅ |
| Documentation | ✅ |
| Recusal | ✅ |

## 5. Networking / Casual Conversation

**Goal:** Be memorable. Keep it human.

**Script:**
> "I'm building an app that turns volunteering into a game. Students earn points for sustainability actions - like bringing a reusable cup or doing a waste audit. Colleges love it because it solves their reporting problem. I'm piloting at Seneca through my club, USFS."

| Mention | Yes/No |
|---------|:------:|
| Legal structure | ❌ |
| Entities | ❌ |

## The Elevator Pitches

### 10 Seconds (Cocktail Party)
> "I gamify volunteering for college students."

### 30 Seconds (Networking)
> "I built SDG Passport - an app that turns sustainability actions into points and badges. Students love the game, colleges love the data for their rankings. Piloting at Seneca now."

### 60 Seconds (Pitch Event)
> "Seneca spends millions on sustainability but scores 0.01/5.00 on student engagement because they can't track it. SDG Passport changes that. Students earn points for actions like waste audits and using reusable cups. We feed that data directly into AASHE STARS. We're partnering with Responsible Cafes - they've proven 40% cup reduction. We're asking for $5,000 to pilot. That's 0.1% of the deficit to fix a major reporting gap."
