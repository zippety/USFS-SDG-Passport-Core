## ⚠️ RECUSAL WORKFLOW

When DJ (as ED) has a conflict of interest:

```
1. DJ identifies conflict (payment to self, contract with Agape Home, etc.)
2. DJ states conflict at board meeting/in resolution
3. DJ leaves the room/call for discussion and vote
4. Remaining directors discuss and vote
5. Decision recorded with "DJ recused" notation
6. DJ returns after vote is complete
```

**Conflicts requiring recusal:**
- ❌ DJ's salary or benefits
- ❌ Contracts with Agape Home Inc.
- ❌ Reimbursements to DJ personally
- ❌ Any decision where DJ has financial interest

## 🚨 EMERGENCY DECISIONS

When urgent action is needed and full board cannot convene:

| Situation | Who Can Act | Requirements |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| **Emergency expense** (<$2k) | ED alone | Document within 48 hours |
| **Emergency expense** (>$2k) | ED + any 1 Director | Email approval, ratify at next meeting |
| **System security breach** | ED alone | Immediate action, notify Board within 24 hours |
| **Legal threat received** | ED | Notify Board Chair immediately |

**Ratification:** All emergency decisions must be ratified at the next board meeting.

## 📈 ESCALATION PATH

When unsure about authority:

```
1. Check this document
2. If unclear → Ask Treasurer
3. If still unclear → Ask Board Chair
4. If urgent → Use emergency procedure, ratify later
5. If potentially illegal → STOP. Get legal advice.
```
