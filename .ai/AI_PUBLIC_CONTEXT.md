**Purpose**: This document provides context for AI assistants and contributors working on the SDG Passport core technology.

## 🏛️ ORGANIZATION: SDG Innovation Labs
**Legal Structure**: Federal Non-Profit Corporation (Not-for-profit)
**Mission**: To provide post-secondary institutions with tools to measure and encourage sustainability engagement.
**Core Product**: SDG Passport (A "Living Lab" platform).

## 🛠️ PROJECT OVERVIEW
The **SDG Passport** is a web-based decentralized app (dApp) that allows students to:
1.  **Log Impact**: Record actions (planting trees, attending workshops) connected to specific SDGs.
2.  **Earn Verification**: Get validated by campus partners (e.g., responsible cafes, sustainability offices).

## 💻 TECH STACK
*   **Frontend**: React, Vite, TypeScript, TailwindCSS
*   **State**: Zustand
*   **Backend**: Firebase (MVP) / Node.js (Roadmap)
*   **Philosophy**: "Vibe Coding" - Code should be clean, readable, and written with positive intention.

## ⚖️ GOVERNANCE & COMPLIANCE
**Strict Separation of Concerns:**
*   This repository is managed by **SDG Innovation Labs**.
*   All contributions via **Canada Summer Jobs (CSJ)** or **SWPP** must remain Open Source or owned by the Non-Profit to comply with grant funding rules.

## 🤝 CONTRIBUTION RULES
1.  **No proprietary data**: Do not commit secrets, keys, or personal user data.
2.  **Accessibility first**: All UI must be AODA compliant.
3.  **Sustainable Code**:Optimize for low energy usage (efficient algorithms, dark mode default).

## 🎓 STUDENT DEVELOPER ROLE
*   **Focus**: Frontend components, gamification logic, impact visualization.
*   **Goal**: Learn real-world software development in a supported environment.
*   **Credit**: All contributors are listed in the `CONTRIBUTORS.md` file.
