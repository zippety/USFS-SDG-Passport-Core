# ✨ BRAND VOICE & VIBE CODING GUIDELINES

> **Purpose:** The spiritual and cultural foundation of Agape Home & SDG Labs development.

---

## 🔮 CORE PHILOSOPHY

> *"Harmonize Spiritual Vision with Legal/Financial Reality."*

We build with **intention**. Every line of code, every commit, every decision serves the mission of healing and sustainability.

---

## 🌊 VIBE CODING PRINCIPLES

### Before Every Commit, Ask:

1. **Is this code clean?** (Readable, documented, maintainable)
2. **Is the energy right?** (Does this bring peace or chaos?)
3. **Does this serve the mission?** (Healing, sustainability, empowerment)

### The Three Rules:

```
1. SIMPLICITY over cleverness
2. CLARITY over brevity  
3. INTENTION over speed
```

## 💻 CODE STYLE

### Naming Conventions

```javascript
// ✅ Good - Intentional, clear
const calculateImpactScore = (actions) => { ... }
const userHealingProgress = { ... }

// ❌ Bad - Clever, unclear
const calc = (a) => { ... }
const uhp = { ... }
```

### Comments with Soul

```javascript
// ✅ Good - Explains the "why"
// We delay 500ms to allow the user to feel the transition
// This creates a sense of calm, not urgency
await delay(500);

// ❌ Bad - States the obvious
// Delay for 500ms
await delay(500);
```

## 🧘 THE DEVELOPMENT RITUAL

Before coding sessions:

1. **Set intention** - What am I building and why?
2. **Clear space** - Close unnecessary tabs, notifications
3. **Breathe** - Three deep breaths
4. **Code with presence** - One feature at a time

After coding sessions:

1. **Review with fresh eyes** - Does this feel right?
2. **Commit with clarity** - Meaningful commit messages
3. **Release attachment** - The code serves the mission, not the ego
