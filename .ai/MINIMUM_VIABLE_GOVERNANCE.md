## 🚦 THE SEVEN GATES

Before ANY financial action, confirm ALL of these:

| # | Gate | Check |
|---|------|:-----:|
| 1 | **Correct entity identified?** (SDG Labs vs Agape) | ☐ |
| 2 | **Budget line exists for this spend?** | ☐ |
| 3 | **If CSJ/SWPP funds: recipient is NOT a director/founder?** | ☐ |
| 4 | **If paying DJ: Board resolution exists?** | ☐ |
| 5 | **Correct bank account being used?** | ☐ |
| 6 | **Receipt/invoice ready to file?** | ☐ |
| 7 | **No conflict of interest requiring recusal?** | ☐ |

If ALL SEVEN = YES → PROCEED with action
If ANY = NO → STOP and resolve first
If UNSURE → Check AUDIT_CHECKLIST.md
