# CEO Leadership Roadmap: From Director to Visionary

**Goal**: Establish yourself not just as a creative contributor, but as the inevitable leader of the venture.

## 1. The Mindset: "The Builder-Leader"
A CEO doesn't just suggest ideas; they **build** the foundation.
*   **Old Way (Director)**: "Here is an idea for an app."
*   **New Way (CEO)**: "Here is the code I built. Here is the culture I'm installing. Here is the future."

## 2. Monday Meeting Strategy (4 PM)
**Theme**: "Velocity & Vision"

### A. The "Power Move" (Github)
*   **Action**: Pushing the code to a public/organization repository before the meeting.
*   **The Script**: "I've already initialized the repository and pushed the MVP code. We aren't starting from zero; we're already moving. This allows us to start iterating immediately."
*   **Why**: It proves you are the technical anchor. They cannot build this without you.

### B. The "Culture" Move (AI Inclusion)
*   **Action**: Explicitly ask everyone to open their preferred AI (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini) during the brainstorm.
*   **The Script**: "In this club, we practice Hybrid Intelligence. If you're stuck, ask your AI. Let's see what *we* can co-create with *them*."
*   **Why**: It positions you as the modern, forward-thinking leader who understands the future.

### C. The "Communication" Move (Video)
*   **Action**: Use NotebookLM (or similar) to generate an engaging audio/video summary of the Vision Map.
*   **The Script**: "To make this vision accessible to every student, I generated this 5-minute 'Game of Good' podcast/video. This is how we reach Gen Z."
*   **Why**: It shows you understand marketing and content velocity.

## 3. Positioning Statements (RI-English)
*   **Don't say**: "I think I should lead."
*   **Say**: "I experience a strong pull to steward this vision. Leadership flows through my commitment to building this daily."
*   **Don't say**: "Is this okay?"
*   **Say**: "Does this velocity align with our goals?"

## 4. Next Steps
1.  **Initialize Git**: Run the commands to make it real.
2.  **Generate Media**: Yes, use NotebookLM for the 'fun' factor.
3.  **Own the Room**: Walk in with the energy of someone who has already solved the problem.
