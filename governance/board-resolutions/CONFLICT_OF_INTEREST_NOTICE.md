**RE: General Notice of Interest pursuant to Section 141 of the Canada Not-for-profit Corporations Act**

Dear Directors,

In accordance with the conflict of interest provisions of the *Canada Not-for-profit Corporations Act* and the Corporation’s By-laws, I hereby disclose that I am a director, officer, and the sole shareholder of **Agape Home Inc.** ("Agape Home"), a federal corporation.

I understand that the Corporation is considering entering into a **Software License Agreement** with Agape Home to license the "Agape Nexus / SDG Passport" technology (the "Proposed Transaction").

### Nature of Interest
As the sole owner of Agape Home, I have a material interest in the Proposed Transaction. While the license is proposed at a pro-bono rate ($1.00/year), it establishes a contractual relationship between the two entities.

### Declaration of Recusal
To ensure the integrity of the Corporation’s decision-making process and to comply with my fiduciary duties:

1.  I am disclosing this interest **prior** to any vote on the matter.
2.  I will **leave the meeting** during the discussion and voting on the Proposed Transaction.
3.  I will **abstain from voting** on any resolution to approve the Proposed Transaction.

I request that this disclosure be recorded in the minutes of the meeting.

Sincerely,

__________________________
**Duane Bromfield**
Director
