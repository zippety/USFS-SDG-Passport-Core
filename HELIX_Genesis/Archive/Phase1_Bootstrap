# SDG Passport: Phase 1 Complete (The "Trojan Horse")

**Status:** ✅ BUILT & DEPLOYED (Localhost MVP)
**Strategy:** Use the high-fidelity app to secure **Phase 2 Funding (Backend)**.
**Date:** December 2025

## 1. THE STRATEGIC PIVOT
We have moved beyond "Ideas". We now have a **tangible product**.
We are no longer asking for *permission to build*. We are asking for *resources to scale*.

### **The "Trojan Horse" Strategy**
The App looks and feels like a fully funded Tech Startup product, but it is currently running on "Sweat Equity" (Frontend Only).
*   **The Shell:** A beautiful, dark-mode enabled mobile app.
*   **The Inside:** Mock data (Phase 1) ready to be replaced by Real Data (Phase 2).
*   **The Goal:** Show this to Seneca Leadership/SenecaAI to say: *"The car is built. We just need gas (Server Funding)."*

## 2. CURRENT ARSENAL (What is Built)

### **A. Core Gamification (The Hook)**
*   **SDG Passport:** Digital stamp collection for all 17 Goals.
*   **Sustainability Pet ("Eco-Companion"):** An interactive mascot that lives on the home screen. It reacts to user attention. *Strategy: Use this for "Tamagotchi-style" marketing to students.*
*   **Leaderboard:** Visual ranking by Student and by Program.

### **B. Community & Utility (The Sticky features)**
*   **Events Calendar:** A centralized place to see and "Book" USFS workshops. No more Eventbrite.
*   **Community Hub:** A Slack-like chat interface with Channels (`#general`, `#climate-action`). *Strategy: Replace WhatsApp groups with an integrated, branded platform.*

### **C. Internal Alignment (The Command Center)**
*   **Team Dashboard (`/team`):** A hidden "Staff Access" portal.
*   **Features:** Strategy Vault links, Role Clarity Cards, and a Live Kanban Roadmap.
*   **Purpose:** Keeps the Exec team aligned without needing 10 different Notion pages.

## 3. PHASE 2: THE ASK (SenecaAI Partnership)
We are not asking for $700 for pizza. We are asking for **Infrastructure**.

### **The Pitch to SenecaAI:**
*"We have built the frontend interface for the ideal 'Living Lab' student engagement platform. It has Chat, Events, and Gamification built-in."*

**We need:**
1.  **Firebase/Cloud Database:** To make the Chat and Pet state real-time.
2.  **App Store Fees:** To get this on every student's phone.
3.  **The Deal:** USFS becomes the "User Acquisition Engine" for the SenecaAI ecosystem.

## 4. NEXT STEPS (Immediate Action)
1.  **Film the Demo:** Use the implemented features (Dark Mode, Pet Click, Chat Send) to create a high-hype "Launch Trailer".
2.  **Onboard Leadership:** Show Lilia and the Execs the `/team` dashboard.
3.  **The "Fake Door" Test:** Start showing students the "Sustainability Pet" to gauge reaction before we write the complex backend logic for it.
