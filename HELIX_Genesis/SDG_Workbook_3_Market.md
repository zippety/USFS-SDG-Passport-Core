## LEARNING OUTCOMES - MARKET RESEARCH

✅ **Identify your Competitors (Direct & Indirect)**
✅ **Define your Total Addressable Market (TAM)**
✅ **Conduct Primary Research (Sensing)**

---

## 1. MARKET SIZE ( The "Why Now")

*   **The Crisis:** The 2025 international student cap has created an "Enrollment Emergency."
*   **The Need:** Differentiation. Institutions can't compete on price (cuts) or scale. They need **Unique Value Propositions** (UVPs).
*   **The Opportunity:** Sustainability credentials are the #1 requested new feature by Gen Z applicants.
*   **The Stats:** 1,200+ Institutions need this, but 80% lack the tools.

## 2. COMPETITOR ANALYSIS

### Direct Competitors (The Incumbents)
1.  **Modern Campus (Presence)**: The big player.
    *   *Strength*: Deep integration with university systems.
    *   *Weakness*: Boring UI. Students only log in when forced. Low engagement.
2.  **Volgistics / Better Impact**: Volunteer management software.
    *   *Strength*: Good for scheduling.
    *   *Weakness*: It's just a digital timesheet. No gamification. No "social currency."

### Indirect Competitors (The Real Enemy)
1.  **"The Clipboard"**: Manual sign-in sheets.
    *   *Strength*: Free. Everyone knows how to use it.
    *   *Weakness*: Illegible handwriting. Data entry takes hours. Fraud is rampant.
2.  **"Apathy"**: Doing nothing.
    *   *Weakness*: Seneca loses ranking points.

### Why SDG Passport Wins (Differentiation)
We operate in the **"Blue Ocean"** between "Fun Game" and "Boring Compliance Tool."

## 3. PRIMARY RESEARCH (What we found)

**We interviewed:**
1.  Lillia (USFS President)
2.  Agatha (USFS HR)
3.  Seneca Students (Random Sampling)

**Key Insight:**
*   **Agatha's Fear**: "What if people cheat?" -> Validation for our Geofencing Feature.
*   **Lillia's Fear**: "We need to look professional." -> Validation for our "Dark Mode/Premium" Aesthetic.
*   **Student Feedback**: "I'll do it if I get something for my resume." -> Validation for the "LinkedIn Export" feature.

## REFLECTION

**Is there a market for this?**
Yes. The market is not "Students buying an app."
The market is **"Universities buying a Compliance Tool that students actually like."**
Institutions have the budget (Sustainability Funds). They just lack the vendor.
