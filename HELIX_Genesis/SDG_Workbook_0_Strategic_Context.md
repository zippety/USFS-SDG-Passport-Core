# HELIX Genesis Workbook 0: STRATEGIC CONTEXT
## The "Perfect Storm" & The Strategic Reality

**Context:** Institutional Survival & Differentiation

## 1. The Crisis Context (2024-2025)
Seneca Polytechnic is currently navigating a "Perfect Storm" of challenges:

1.  **Enrollment Crisis:** The cap on international students has impacted revenue streams.
2.  **Financial Pressure:** Projected deficits limit capital expenditure.
3.  **Post-Strike Recovery:** The institution is rebuilding student morale and trust.

**Strategic Reality Check:**
SDG Passport **does not** solve the enrollment crisis. To claim otherwise would be irresponsible.
However, it addresses a specific, measurable gap that persists despite the crisis.

## 2. The Specific Pain Point: EN-13
While the institution fights for survival, the **Office of Sustainability** faces its own crisis:
*   **AASHE STARS Score:** Seneca currently scores **0.01/5.00** in Credit EN-13 (Student Sustainability Engagement).
*   **The Cause:** Disconnected data. Thousands of student volunteer hours go unverified because they live in spreadsheets, not systems.
*   **The Cost:** This low score drags down the institution's overall ranking at a time when reputation is critical.

## 3. The Value Proposition Pivot
**Old Pitch:** "We act as a Recruitment Differentiator." (Unsubstantiated).
**New Pitch:** "We solve the EN-13 Data Gap while rebuilding Student Engagement." (Proven).

We offer a **Targeted Solution**:
*   **For Administration:** We automate the data collection specifically for AASHE EN-13, moving the score from 0.01 → 4.00.
*   **For Students:** We provide a "Gamified Impact Transcript" that validates their volunteer work for employers.

## 4. The Ask: Low Risk, Measured Reward
We are asking for a **$5,000 Catalyst Grant**.

*   **Cost:** 0.1% of the projected deficit.
*   **Risk:** Zero infrastructure required (runs on students' phones).
*   **Reward:** 
    1.  Fix a specific reporting gap (EN-13) - **Phase 1 MVP**.
    2.  Provide a morale boost for students post-strike.
    3.  Validate a "Living Lab" model for future curriculum integration (**Phase 2**).

**Strategic Conclusion:**
This pilot is not a silver bullet for enrollment. It is a **Cost-Effective Efficiency Tool** that solves a lingering data problem while supporting student culture during a difficult period.
