# HELIX Genesis Program - Workbook 6: THE PITCH
## SDG Passport - Completed Workbook

**Prepared by:** Duane "DJ" Bromfield
**Business:** SDG Passport (SDG Innovation Labs Inc.)
**Date:** January 2025
**Program:** HELIX Genesis - The Pitch

## SLIDE 1: THE HOOK
**Visual:** A campus building with lights left on at 3 AM vs. a student needing a project.
**Script:**
"Seneca spends millions on energy, waste, and food. Yet we have no idea what's happening on the ground.
Meanwhile, 30,000 students walk past these inefficiencies every day. This is a massive missed opportunity."

---

## SLIDE 2: THE PROBLEM
**Visual:** "The 15-Point Gap" (Seneca's missing AASHE points in Ops).
**Script:**
"We call this **Operational Blindness**.
1.  **Facilities** is understaffed. They can't audit every bin or light switch.
2.  **Sustainability Office** loses 15+ points in AASHE STARS because they lack data.
3.  **Faculty** struggle to find real-world 'Living Lab' projects for students."

---

## SLIDE 3: THE SOLUTION
**Visual:** SDG Passport 'Mission' Interface ("Audit the Cafeteria").
**Script:**
"Enter **SDG Passport: The Living Lab Platform**.
We don't just track volunteers; we deploy **Student Researchers**.
Students accept 'Missions' (e.g., Waste Audit, Energy Check) to earn Micro-Credentials.
We turn the Student Body into a distributed **Data Collection Workforce**.
**Why now?** Because 'Audit-Proof Data' is mandatory for funding."

---

## SLIDE 5: HOW IT WORKS
**Visual:** 1. Professor Assigns Mission -> 2. Student Scans/Audits -> 3. Ops Dashboard Updates.
**Script:**
"1. **Assign**: Faculty post a 'Waste Audit Mission'.
2. **Action**: Student audits the bin + snaps a photo.
3. **Verify**: AI verifies the data. Student gets credit. Ops gets the report."

---

## SLIDE 6: MARKET OPPORTUNITY
**Visual:** $50k Smart Campus vs $5k App.
**Script:**
"We are moving from 'Student Engagement' (Low Value) to **'Smart Campus Operations'** (High Value).
Every University needs this data to reach Net Zero.
We start with Seneca, then scale to the 1,200 AASHE network."

---

## SLIDE 7: BUSINESS MODEL
**Visual:** Revenue Streams ($50k License + $5k Sponsors).
**Script:**
"We have a Hybrid Model:
1.  **Dashboard Subscription ($50k/yr)**: Ops Budget (pays for itself in energy savings).
2.  **Corporate Sponsorships ($5k/badge)**: Partners fund the student rewards.
We prioritize the **Ops Budget** because it is 10x larger than Student Life."

---

## SLIDE 8: TRACTION
**Visual:** USFS Logo + HELIX Logo.
**Script:**
"We aren't just an idea.
*   We are the official platform for the **United Seneca for Sustainability (USFS)**.
*   We have **HELIX Venture** status.
*   Our Phase 1 Web Prototype launches next month."

---

## SLIDE 9: COMPETITION
**Visual:** SDG Passport vs. Smart Building Sensors (Expensive) vs. Manual Audits (Slow).
**Script:**
"Sensors are expensive ($$$). Manual Audits are slow.
We use the **Existing Student Workforce** (Free).
We are the **Uber for Campus Audits**."

---

## SLIDE 10: THE ASK
**Visual:** "$5,000" vs "Deficit Mountain".
**Script:**
"We are asking for a **$5,000 Catalyst Grant**.
That is **0.1% of the projected deficit**.
For the price of a rounding error, you fix a major reporting gap (EN-13) and engage students.
Let's turn this 'Data Black Hole' into a 'Living Lab'."
