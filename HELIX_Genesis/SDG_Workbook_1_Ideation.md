## IDEATION PROCESS

### Question 1: What problem do you want to solve?

**Describe the problem:**

Higher Education Institutions (like Seneca) are facing a **"Sustainability Reporting Gap"**:

1.  **The Data Gap:** We spend millions on sustainability, but our AASHE STARS score for Student Engagement (EN-13) is **0.01/5.00** because we lack data.
2.  **The Engagement Gap:** Students volunteer for clubs and events, but their impact is not tracked centrally, leaving them with "blank resumes."
3.  **The Efficiency Gap:** Sustainability staff are overwhelmed with manual reporting and cannot verify data for rating agencies.

**Core Problem Statement:**
Colleges have a "Data Black Hole" regarding social impact. They cannot prove their engagement numbers to rating agencies (AASHE), resulting in lower rankings. Meanwhile, students do the work but get no verifiable credit.

### Question 2: Who does the problem affect?

#### **Group 1: The Administration (Office of Sustainability)**
**Demographics:**
*   Directors of Sustainability at Colleges/Universities.
*   AASHE STARS Reporting Officers.
*   Student Life Coordinators.

**Characteristics:**
*   **Recruitment/Enrollment:** Needs a unique story to tell domestic students.
*   **Student Affairs:** Needs to rebuild morale post-strike.
*   **Sustainability:** Needs a "Win" that costs $0 in infrastructure.

#### **Group 2: The Students (Gen Z)**
**Demographics:**
*   Age 18-25, "Digital Natives."
*   Values-driven but resume-focused.

**Characteristics:**
*   Will not participate if it feels like "work."
*   Love "Gamification" (Streaks, Badges, Leaderboards).
*   Need "Micro-Credentials" to distinguish themselves in the job market.

#### **Group 3: Student Unions (SSF)**
**Demographics:**
*   Club Managers and Finance VPs.

**Characteristics:**
*   Want to fund successful clubs but lack visibility on ROI.
*   Need a way to track attendance without paper fraud.

---

### Question 3: How are they affected?

*   **Administration:** Loses funding and prestige (lower rankings) because they can't prove their impact.
*   **Students:** Graduate with a "blank resume" despite volunteering, because their hours weren't tracked centraly.
*   **SSF:** Wastes budget on events with low attendance because they don't know what students actually want.

## SOLUTION: SDG PASSPORT

4.  🚀 **Launch Phase 1** (Web Prototype) for the next major event.

### Business Development:
*   Secure "HELIX Venture" status to unlock SSF procurement.

## REFLECTION

**What did you learn through this ideation process?**

I learned that **Sustainability is a Data Problem, not just a Culture Problem.**

Everybody wants to save the world, but nobody measures it. By pivoting from a "Club App" to a "Compliance Tool" (AASHE STARS), I turned a nice-to-have project into a **Must-Have Business Solution** for the college.

**SDG Passport bridges the gap between Student Passion and Institutional Compliance.**
