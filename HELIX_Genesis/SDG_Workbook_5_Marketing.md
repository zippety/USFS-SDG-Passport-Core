# HELIX Genesis Workbook 5 – Customer Validation (SDG Passport)

## 1. Interview Question Bank
Goal: Confirm the "Sustainability Engagement Gap" and the need for Automated Data.

### A. Foundational Warm-Up
1.  **For Students:** "When was the last time you volunteered on campus? Did you get any credit for it?"
2.  **For Directors:** "How do you currently track student attendance at events? Is it accurate?"
3.  **For Club Leaders:** "What is your biggest pain point when trying to get students to show up?"

### B. Segment-Specific Probes

**Students (The User)**
*   "Would you care more about volunteering if you got a digital 'Badge' you could put on LinkedIn?"
*   "Do you know what the UN SDGs are? Do you care?"
*   "If an app gave you free coffee for attending 5 events, would you download it?"

**Directors (The Buyer)**
*   "Do you struggle to get full points for AASHE STARS Credit EN-13 (Community Service)?"
*   "How many hours a week do you spend manually entering data from sign-in sheets?"
*   "If we could give you an 'Audit-Proof Report' instantly, what would that be worth to you?"

**Sponsors (The Revenue)**
*   "Is reaching Gen Z students a priority for your brand?"
*   "Would you sponsor a 'Financial Literacy Badge' inside a student app?"

## 3. Validation Results (Simulated)

### Key Findings
1.  **The Pain is Real:** The Director admitted that AASHE reporting takes "weeks of manual work."
2.  **Students Want Credit:** 90% of students said they volunteer *less* because "it doesn't help my resume."
3.  **Clubs need Tools:** USFS leaders confirmed they have no way to verify who actually attends events.

### Pivot Decision
*   **Original Idea:** Just a "Club Website."
*   **Feedback:** "Nobody visits websites anymore."
*   **New Idea:** **SDG Passport App** (Mobile + Gamified).
*   **Feedback:** "I would download that for the rewards." -> **Stronger Value Prop.**
