## 1. CUSTOMER PERSONAS

### Persona A: "Sustainable Sarah" (The Super-User)
*   **Role:** 2nd Year Environmental Tech Student.
*   **Motivation:** Wants to save the world, but feels isolated.
*   **Pain Point:** Volunteers for 3 different clubs (Eco, Garden, Cleanup) but has no single record of her impact. She feels her work is "invisible."
*   **Gain:** A digital portfolio that aggregates all her actions into one "Impact Score" she can put on LinkedIn.

### Persona B: "Director David" (The Buyer)
*   **Role:** Director of Sustainability (Seneca).
*   **Motivation:** Needs to get Seneca to "Platinum" status on AASHE STARS.
*   **Pain Point:** Drowning in spreadsheets. Relies on emails from club presidents to guess how many students attended events. Terrified of an audit.
*   **Gain:** A "One-Click Audit" Dashboard. He opens the app, sees "500 Attendees," and downloads the PDF for the rating agency.

### Persona C: "Apathetic Alex" (The Target Growth)
*   **Role:** Business Student.
*   **Motivation:** Getting a job. Doesn't care about trees.
*   **Pain Point:** Needs "Leadership Experience" for his resume but thinks volunteering is boring.
*   **Gain:** The "Gamification." He sees his friends leveling up and getting badges. He joins because he wants to win, not because he cares (yet). The app creates the habit.

## 2. THE PROBLEM-SOLUTION FIT

| **Customer Job** | **Pain (Why it's hard)** | **Gain (What they want)** | **SDG Passport Feature** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Prove Student Impact** | Data is scattered across papers, emails, and discords. | A clean, verifiable report for AASHE accreditation. | **Real-Time Dashboard**: Automated collection of every scan. |
| **Boost Engagement** | Students don't show up to events because there is no incentive. | Higher attendance numbers and buzz on campus. | **Gamification**: XP, Leaderboards, and Digital Badges. |
| **Prevent Fraud** | Students sign in for friends who aren't there. | Actual, honest attendance numbers. | **Geofencing & Rotating QR**: Anti-cheat technology. |

## 3. THE "MINIMUM VIABLE ECOSYSTEM" (MVE)

We are not just building an "App." We are building a **Feedback Loop**.

1.  **The Event (Physical)**: Student attends a cleanup.
2.  **The Trigger (Digital)**: Student scans the Geofenced QR Code.
3.  **The Reward (Psychological)**: Phone vibrates. "Badge Unlocked." XP Bar goes up.
4.  **The Report (Institutional)**: Director David's dashboard updates instantly.

## REFLECTION

**How has your understanding of the customer changed?**

I realized that **"Apathetic Alex"** is actually my most important user.
"Sustainable Sarah" will join anyway.
But if I can make the app cool enough for "Alex" (the business student) to care, then we have truly solved the engagement crisis. **Gamification isn't a toy; it's the bridge for the unconverted.**
