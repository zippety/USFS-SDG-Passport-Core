## Responsible Cafes Integration Pitch

### The Concept

> "Students scan a QR code when they use a reusable cup at partner cafés. They earn SDG points. You get tracked impact data. Seneca gets AASHE STARS points."

### How It Would Work

1. **Student opens SDG Passport app**
2. **Scans QR code at café** (on receipt, table stand, or counter)
3. **Earns "Reusable Champion" stamp** (SDG 12: Responsible Consumption)
4. **Leaderboard updates** - students can see who's saving the most cups
5. **Your dashboard** shows: X students, Y cup uses, Z% reduction

### What You (Responsible Cafes) Get

| Benefit | How |
|---------|-----|
| **Automated tracking** | No more manual sign-ups |
| **Impact data** | "500 cups saved this month" |
| **Student engagement** | Gamification drives repeat behavior |
| **Scale** | We expand to other campuses = you expand |

### What We (SDG Passport) Get

| Benefit | How |
|---------|-----|
| **Daily user engagement** | Students open app to log cup use |
| **Real-world proof** | Not just workshops, actual behavior change |
| **AASHE STARS data** | OP-18 Waste Reduction metrics |
| **Partnership credibility** | "Partnered with Responsible Cafes TO" |

## Key Talking Points

1. **"We're not competing - we're complementary."**
   - You have the café network + ambassador model
   - We have the gamification + tracking technology

2. **"Your 40% cup reduction, our data layer."**
   - Your results are proven
   - We make them measurable and scalable

3. **"Seneca first, then other campuses."**
   - Pilot at 3-5 cafés near Seneca Newnham
   - Expand together to UofT, George Brown, Humber

4. **"No money changes hands - mutual benefit."**
   - This is a partnership, not a vendor relationship
   - MOU, not a contract

---

## Questions to Ask Kiethan

1. "How do you currently track cup reduction?"
2. "What data would be most valuable for your sponsors/grants?"
3. "Which cafés near Seneca are already in your network?"
4. "Would a 30-day pilot with USFS club members be a good start?"

---

## Your Ask (End of Call)

> "Can we pilot this at 3 partner cafés near Seneca Newnham in January? I'll build the QR tracking feature, USFS promotes to students, your ambassadors help onboard cafés."

*Ready to demo. Good luck! 🚀*
