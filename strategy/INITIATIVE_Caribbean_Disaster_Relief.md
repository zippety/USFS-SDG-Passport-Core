## Success Metrics

### Pilot Phase
- 100% receipts posted publicly
- Weekly updates for 24-36 weeks
- Both homes completed within 9 months
- Zero fraud incidents
- Model documented for replication

### Sustainability Strategy: RI Money (Endowment Model)

**Concept:** Relief fund that grows itself through compound interest

**Investment Allocation:**
- **Emergency Fund (50%):** High-interest savings account (4-5% annual return)
  - Zero risk, CDIC insured
  - Instant access for disaster response
  - EQ Bank, Tangerine, or Wealthsimple Save

- **Growth Fund (50%):** Socially responsible investment portfolio (6-8% annual return)
  - Moderate risk, ESG/impact investing
  - Green bonds, community development funds, ethical index funds
  - Wealthsimple Invest or similar platform

**Example Growth:**
- Start: $50,000 relief fund
- Year 1: $53,000 (6% average return)
- Year 3: $59,550
- Year 5: $66,911
- Interest earned can fund small emergency grants while principal grows

**Implementation:**
- Set up once Agape Home/Foundation is registered
- No partnership needed - direct account opening
- Quarterly rebalancing
- Annual impact reporting (financial + social returns)

**Alignment:** Money grows while doing good (impact investing = Agape values)

### Platform Phase (Year 2-5)
- 200 campaigns by Year 5
- $8M raised by Year 5
- 95%+ campaigns with full documentation
- 200+ homes rebuilt
- 500+ jobs for Caribbean contractors

## Risk Management

**Fundraising shortfall:** Multi-platform approach, phased reconstruction, backup funding  
**Transparency fatigue:** Simple tools, shared responsibilities, templates  
**Contractor issues:** Multiple quotes, licensed only, escrow payments, family oversight  
**Platform delays:** MVP approach, phased development, 20% budget buffer  
**Fraud:** Multiple oversight layers, public receipts, legal agreements  
**Scope creep:** Phased approach, clear boundaries, quarterly reviews
