## The Mutual Value Exchange

| **AASHE STARS points** | OP-18 Waste Reduction data |
| **Differentiation** | Only platform with reusable cup tracking |
| **HELIX pitch proof** | "Partnered with proven Toronto initiative" |

## Product Integration: Reusable Cup Tracker

### Feature Concept

1. Students log every BYO cup use at participating cafés
2. Earn points/badges ("Reusable Champion" after 25 uses)
3. See impact metrics ("You saved 47 cups this semester! 🌍")
4. Campus leaderboards (individual + café rankings)
5. Real behavior data for AASHE STARS reporting

### Where This Gets Built

| Component | Built By | Owner |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| QR check-in feature | DJ / Agape devs | **Agape Home** |
| SDG Passport integration | DJ / Agape devs | **Agape Home** |
| User training, rollout | CSJ students | SDG Labs operations |
| Café onboarding | CSJ students + Responsible Cafes | Partnership |

✅ **This fits Option B:** DJ builds the feature, CSJ students run the program.

## Legal/Governance Fit

| Check | Status |
|-------|:------:|
| No conflict with Agape Home mission | ✅ External partner |
| CSJ students do program work, not code | ✅ Onboarding, promotion |
| Feature owned by Agape | ✅ DJ builds it |
| MOU (no money exchanged) | ✅ Mutual benefit |

---

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| **They're not interested** | Pitch free Year 1 integration, emphasize tech + scale |
| **Cafés don't want QR scans** | Self-reported honor system + spot checks |
| **Data privacy concerns** | Aggregate data only, PIPEDA compliant |
| **Slow adoption** | CSJ students as on-ground ambassadors |

## Outreach Template

> Subject: SDG Passport x Responsible Cafes - partnership idea
>
> Hey Kiethan,
>
> I'm DJ, building SDG Passport - a gamified platform that tracks student sustainability actions at Seneca and beyond. I caught your HELIX pitch and I'm really impressed by what you're doing with Responsible Cafes.
>
> Quick idea: What if students could earn SDG points every time they use a reusable cup at participating cafés? We'd build the tracking/gamification layer, you provide the café network.
>
> Benefits for you:
> - Automated tracking (no more manual sign-ups)
> - Gamification = more engagement
> - Professional impact data for sponsors/grants
> - Scales with us to other campuses
>
> Would you be open to a 15-min coffee chat (reusable cup, of course ☕) to explore this?
>
