## Your Talking Points

### If She Asks "What is SDG Passport?"

> "It's a gamified platform that tracks student sustainability actions and turns them into points, badges, and a digital portfolio. Colleges can use the data for AASHE STARS reporting. We're building it as the official platform for USFS."

### If She Asks "What Do You Need From Me?"

> "Three things: 1) USFS endorsement so members trust it, 2) Help identifying pilot events this semester, 3) Feedback on what features matter most to your members."

### If She Asks About Responsible Cafes

> "They've proven 40% cup reduction at partner cafés. We want to add a 'Reusable Cup Tracker' feature to SDG Passport. Students earn points for BYO cups at participating cafés. USFS would promote it, they get the café network."
