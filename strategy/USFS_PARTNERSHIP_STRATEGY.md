# Strategy for Your USFS (United Seneca for Sustainability) Call

You are the **SDG Creative Director** for USFS. You need to brief your team on a major opportunity brought to you by **CafeTO**.

Here is the corrected narrative.

### **The "One-Liner" Purpose**
"CafeTO wants to partner with Seneca. They specifically want to work with **USFS** and **Enactus** together. I am setting up a meeting with Kiethan (Enactus) and I want USFS leadership there."

***

### **Detailed Talking Points (Script)**

**1. The Catalyst (CafeTO)**
> "I’ve been in talks with **Responsible CafeTO**. They are eager to launch a sustainable cup program at Seneca, but they don't want to just be a vendor. They want to build a coalition with student leadership."

**2. The Opportunity (The Coalition)**
> "CafeTO specifically identified **USFS** (us) and **Enactus** as the two key partners they need.
> *   **USFS Role:** Leading the student engagement and UN alignment.
> *   **Enactus Role:** Providing the operational manpower (circular economy).
> *   **My Role (SDG Passport):** Providing the app to track it all."

**3. The Next Step (The Kiethan Meeting)**
> "I haven't formally met with **Kiethan (VP of Enactus/SEA)** yet, but I am scheduling a call.
>
> **My Proposal:** I don't want to go alone. I want to invite a member of the USFS exec team to join me. We should present a **'United Foundation'** to Enactus—showing that USFS and CafeTO are already aligned and inviting them to join *us*."

### **Message to USFS Leadership**

"**Update:** **CafeTO** has approached me about a pilot. They want to work with **USFS** and **Enactus** to track sustainable actions on campus.

I am scheduling a strategy session with **Kiethan Theva (Enactus/SEA)** to discuss how we can all work together.

**Strategic Opportunity:**
Instead of competing for projects, this is a chance for **USFS to be the bridge**. If we join this meeting, we position USFS as the 'unifying force' that brought CafeTO and Enactus together under the UN banner.

### **The Collaboration Model (How it works)**

This is not "CafeTO vs USFS." This is a **Three-Pillar Ecosystem**, and each group needs the others to succeed.

#### **1. USFS (The Voice & Culture) 🗣️**
*   **Superpower:** Student Engagement & UN Alignment.
*   **Role:** You run the *marketing campaigns*, host the *launch events*, and recruit the students to participate. You make sustainability "cool" and align it with the UN SDGs.
*   **Benefit:** USFS gets branded credit for every student who participates.

#### **2. Enactus (The Hands & Operations) 🛠️**
*   **Superpower:** Execution & Grant Writing.
*   **Role:** They manage the *logistics*. They check if the cafes represent the circular economy, handle the grant reporting, and use the data to win competitions.
*   **Benefit:** They get the "hard data" (waste reduction metrics) they need for their Nationals presentations.

#### **3. CafeTO (The Venue) ☕**
*   **Superpower:** Infrastructure.
*   **Role:** They provide the *locations* (the cafes) and the *system* (the reusable cup program).
*   **Benefit:** They get customers and proof of concept.

#### **The Glue: SDG Passport 📱**
*   **Role:** The digital layer that connects them.
    *   Student goes to Cafe (CafeTO) ->
    *   Scans code (SDG Passport) ->
    *   Points go to USFS Leaderboard (Culture) ->
    *   Data goes to Enactus Report (Ops).

**Pitch to USFS:** "We don't need to do the heavy lifting of managing cups (Enactus does that). We just need to get students excited to use them (USFS does that)."

### **Message to USFS Leadership (The "Co-Lead" Approach)**

**Option 1: The "Co-Lead" Pitch (Stronger)**
> "CafeTO is exploring a campus sustainability pilot. I'm connecting them with **Enactus** (Kiethan) and **USFS** because I think you three should be **co-leads** on this.
>
> The idea: use an app to track student impact across waste reduction, volunteering, and eco-projects.
>
> **USFS** would own the 'volunteer' layer. I'm organizing a call to align the groups. Who from execs wants to join to represent the USFS side?"

**Option 2: The "Ecosystem" Pitch (Balanced)**
> "Three groups should talk: **CafeTO**, **Enactus**, and **USFS**. They each have a piece of a sustainability ecosystem that doesn't exist yet.
>
> I'm facilitating the conversation. Specifically, we'd discuss how your volunteer network could amplify both Enactus's projects and CafeTO's waste reduction goals.
>
> I'm scheduling a call with Kiethan (Enactus). Who wants to join to explore this?"
