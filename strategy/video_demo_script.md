## [0:00 - 0:15] The Opening: Strategic Vision
**Visual:** High-fidelity transition: United Seneca for Sustainability (USFS) Logo fades into a clean, Dark Mode dashboard view.
**Audio (Voiceover):**
"In the drive for campus-wide sustainability, data is our most valuable asset. Today, we’re moving beyond theory. Welcome to the SDG Passport—the digital infrastructure for Seneca’s Living Lab ecosystem."

## [0:15 - 0:45] The Problem & The Solution
**Visual:** Quick contrast. Slide A: "Manual Tracking" (messy paper sheets). Slide B: "Automated Data" (Clean, real-time charts).
**Audio (Voiceover):**
"Manual impact tracking is inconsistent and labor-intensive. The SDG Passport automates this process. By connecting student engagement directly to UN Sustainable Development Goals, we transform campus actions into verifiable institutional metrics."

## [0:45 - 1:30] Feature Walkthrough: Connectivity & Impact
**Visual:** Smooth screen recording of the app (Direct, high-contrast UI).
**Audio (Voiceover):**
1. **The Passport Interface:** "Our 'Command Center' design provides students with a professional interface to track their contributions. Every XP point earned is a direct reflection of institutional impact."
2. **The Digital Register (QR Scan):** "Verification is instantaneous. When a student scans at an event or a partner café, the system logs the time, location, and the specific SDG impacted."
3. **The Data Ecosystem:** "This isn’t just an app for students; it’s a tool for leadership. Our cloud infrastructure ensures that every check-in is securely logged and ready for immediate review."

## [1:30 - 1:50] Institutional Benefits: The Dashboard
**Visual:** Preview of the "Director's Dashboard" showing real-time attendance and AASHE STARS metric tracking.
**Audio (Voiceover):**
"For Directors, this means real-time attendance lists and automated reports for AASHE STARS and grant requirements. We’ve built the digital piping that flows data from student phones directly to your impact reports."

## [1:50 - 2:00] Closing: The Smart Campus Initiative
**Visual:** Professional graphic: "SDG Passport | Operational Excellence."
**Audio (Voiceover):**
"Phase 1 is complete. We are now activating our connectivity ecosystem. Join us as we build the future of campus operations. SDG Passport: Innovate, Engage, Impact."

### 🏛️ Director's Note:
- **Tone Check:** Avoid casual slang. Focus on words like "Infrastructure," "Metrics," "Verifiable," and "Operational."
- **Visuals:** Ensure any screen recording used shows the **Inter** font and **Seneca Red/USFS Green** color palette.
- **Goal:** The viewer should walk away feeling like this is a necessary, high-end tool for the institution.
