## 🌿 Responsible Cafes TO (PRIORITY PARTNER)

**Contact:** [Add name/email]
**Website:** https://responsiblecafesto.ca

### Why This Fits SDG Passport

| SDG Passport Need | Responsible Cafes Offers |
|-------------------|-------------------------|
| Real-world trackable actions | Network of participating cafés |
| Student engagement | BYO cup behavior change |
| AASHE STARS data (EN-13) | Measurable waste reduction |
| Campus presence | Seneca-area locations |

### Partnership Concept

> Students scan QR code at participating café when using reusable cup → Earn SDG Points → Contributes to campus sustainability metrics

### Pitch Points for Them

1. **Track impact data** - Know exactly how many cups saved
2. **Gamify behavior** - Students compete for sustainability points
3. **Campus distribution** - USFS club promotes to 1000+ students
4. **Case study** - Publishable impact story for new café partners

### Next Steps

- [ ] Send partnership pitch email
- [ ] Schedule coffee chat
- [ ] Propose 2-3 café pilot near Seneca
- [ ] Design simple QR check-in feature

## 🏥 MorganAI

**Contact:** [Add name/email]
**Focus:** PHIPA-compliant voice AI for clinics

### Why It's Interesting

- Voice booking, SMS confirmation, no-show reduction
- Could apply to Agape Nexus wellness appointments later
- PHIPA compliance infrastructure is expensive to build

### Status

🟡 **Medium priority** - More relevant for Agape than SDG Passport. Revisit when Agape Nexus development starts.

### Next Steps

- [ ] Connect on LinkedIn
- [ ] Keep warm - brief follow-up email
- [ ] Revisit in 2026 when Agape Nexus progresses

## 🧠 AI SkillHub Academy

**Contact:** Azamat Smailov (via Genzai)
**LinkedIn:** https://ca.linkedin.com/in/azamat-smailov

### Why Skipped

- Different focus (AI skills vs SDG actions)
- DJ's energy is on SDG Passport with existing team
- No immediate synergy for current priorities

### If Revisiting Later

- Gamification mechanics overlap
- AI-graded assessments could inform SDG Passport quiz features

## 🤟 SignAI

**Contact:** [Add if obtained]
**Focus:** Sign language to speech translation

### Learn From

## 🤖 Biento

**Contact:** [Add if obtained]
**Focus:** Flexible robotics kits for education

### Future Potential

- STEM education overlaps with SDG education

### Status

🟢 **Watch** - Keep in network for potential SDG x STEM integration.
