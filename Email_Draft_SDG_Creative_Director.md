Dear Agatha,

Thank you so much for the wonderful news and the detailed feedback. I am absolutely thrilled to accept the position of **SDG Creative Director**.

I also want to share that this concept was born from a unique collaborative workflow: combining **advanced AI partnership** with the holistic principles of **Reiki Intelligence**. I believe this fusion—where cutting-edge technology meets deep, intuitive human connection—is the future of Social Innovation, and I’m honored that USFS sees the value in this forward-thinking approach.

It is a privilege to be given the space to innovate and drive impact in this capacity. I am eager to begin collaborating with the Marketing, Project Research, and Event Management Directors to bring a cohesive and creative vision to our SDG initiatives.
