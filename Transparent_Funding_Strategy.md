# Funding & Sustainability Strategy: From Club to Venture

**Mission**: To transition USFS from a volunteer-based student club to a financially sustainable EdTech venture where contributors are compensated for their Impact Work.



## 💰 Revenue Model 1: B2B Licensing (The "SaaS" Model)
**Concept**: We built the "SDG Passport" platform. Other schools need it.
*   **The Problem**: Every college has an "Office of Sustainability" and needs to report student engagement. They have budgets but no tools.
*   **The Solution**: We license our App + Admin Dashboard to other institutions (Humber, York, UofT).
*   **Pricing**:
    *   **Setup Fee**: $2,500 (Onboarding & Branding)
    *   **Annual License**: $5,000/year per campus.
*   **Goal**: 10 Pilot Schools = **$50,000/year revenue**.

**Strategy Upgrade: The "Referral Loop"**
*   **The Problem**: Deans are slow to buy.
*   **The Pivot**: Sell to **Student Unions**.
*   **Pitch**: "Seneca is beating you on the Leaderboard. Buy this app to compete." (FOMO).


## 🤝 Revenue Model 2: Corporate Sponsorship (The "Badge" Model)
**Concept**: Companies want to be seen supporting specific SDGs.
*   **The Mechanism**: "Sponsored Badges" within the app.
*   **Example**:
    *   **RBC** sponsors the **SDG 8 (Decent Work)** Badge.
    *   When a student completes a challenge for SDG 8, they earn the "RBC Economic Empowerment Badge."
    *   RBC pays **$10,000/year** for this targeted brand visibility and "Impact Association."
*   **Target Sponsors**:
    *   **Banking**: Financial Literacy Badges.
    *   **Grocery Chains**: Zero Hunger Badges.
    *   **Tech Companies**: Innovation Badges.

## 🏛️ Revenue Model 3: Grants & Incubation (The "Seed" Capital)
**Concept**: Non-dilutive funding to build the foundation.

### 1. Seneca HELIX Catalyst Fund
*   **Target**: "Accelerating HELIXers" (That's us).
*   **Value**: Microgrants up to **$5,000**.
*   **Use**: "Market testing" and "Launching products" (perfect for our MVP).
*   **Action**: Apply as soon as we incorporate the 'Spin-Out' venture.

### 2. RBC Future Launch Community Challenge
*   **Target**: Youth-led projects addressing local needs (SDGs).
*   **Value**: Grants up to **$15,000**.
*   **Alignment**: Perfect for our "Sponsored Badges" pitch later.

### 3. Student & Eco Grants
*   **Trellis Fund**: **$2,500** grants for students in clean energy transition.
*   **Student Energy Green Jobs**: Wage subsidies to help pay our first employees.
*   **Ontario Youth Entrepreneurship Fund**: Up to **$25,000** for student ventures (High Priority).
*   **NRC IRAP**: Federal funding for "Technical Innovation" (Apply for this once we have the MVP).



### 4. The "Youth-Led" Application Strategy (Age 30+ Pivot)
*   **The Constraint**: Many grants are for "Youth" (15-29).
*   **The Strategy**:
    *   **The Applicants**: Lillia (or other student leaders) are the "Face" on the application.
    *   **The Mentor**: You (Duane) are the "Strategic Advisor" or "Technical Lead."
    *   **Why this works**: Grants *love* mentorship models. It shows the youth are supported by experienced leadership.

## 💼 The "Paid Team" Structure
*How we distribute the revenue to make this a lifestyle.*

**Phase 1: The "Bounty" Model (0 - $20k Revenue)**
*   Nobody takes a salary yet.
*   Revenue is used for **"Task Bounties"**:
    *   "Fix this bug": $50
    *   "Run this event": $100
    *   "Design these assets": $150
*   *Why*: Keeps us lean and rewards output immediately.

**Phase 2: The "Stipend" Model ($20k - $100k Revenue)**
*   Core Directors (CEO, Marketing, Creative) receive a monthly stipend (e.g., $1,000/mo).
*   Continued bounties for contributors.

**Phase 3: The "Salary" Model ($100k+ Revenue)**
*   Full-time roles.
*   Sustainable careers in Social Innovation.

## �️ Strategic Defense: Handling Objections
*The "Winning Answers" for your meetings.*

| **Stakeholder** | **Likely Objection** | **Your Winning Answer** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Seneca HELIX** | *"This looks like you're just trying to profit off the school."* | *"No, we are building a sustainable vendor. If we don't charge, the project dies when we graduate. This model ensures the app survives forever."* |
| **Student Union** | *"Why should we pay you $5,000?"* | *"Because it costs $50,000 to build this from scratch. You get a $50k asset for $5k because we are students too."* |
| **RBC / Sponsors** | *"We don't sponsor for-profit companies."* | *"You aren't sponsoring the company. You are sponsoring the **Student Club Event**. The Club then hires us to build the tech for that event."* |


## ✅ Next Steps
1.  **Validate**: Pitch "Revenue Model 2" (Sponsorships) to the Directors on Monday.
2.  **Build**: Ensure the App can handle "Sponsor Logos" on badges.
3.  **Apply**: Submit this Strategy to HELIX as part of our business evolution.

## ⚖️ Legal Structure: The "Social Enterprise" Corporation
*How to balance profit with purpose.*

**The Entity**: **SDG Passport Inc.** (A Federal Corporation).
*   *Not a Non-Profit. Not a Co-op. A for-profit company with a social contract.*

**The "Social Lock" (Shareholders Agreement)**:
*   **The 10% Pledge**: We legally bind the company to donate 10% of Net Profits to the "SDG Impact Fund" (Managed by USFS).
*   **Asset Lock**: If the company is sold, the "Impact Fund" receives a 10% exit bonus.

**The "Founder-Safe" Share Structure**:
*   **Class A Common (The Captains)**: Held by Founders. 10 Votes/Share. Controls the Board, Vision, and Hiring.
*   **Class B Preferred (The Crew)**: Held by Core Team. 1 Vote/Share. Entitled to **Dividends** (Profit Sharing).
*   **Vesting**: Class B shares vest over 4 years. If you leave early, you lose unvested shares. This ensures only *active* contributors benefit from the wealth.

### 🔄 Anti-Corruption Protocol (The "Arm's Length" Rule)
*   **The Problem**: We are Advisors to the Club. If the Club pays **Us** (The Team), it looks like "Corruption."
*   **The Solution (The Bid)**: We must prove **we** are the best option.
*   **The Analogy**: 
    > Imagine the Club needs a plumber. **We** are the plumber.
    > If they just hand **us** cash, it looks suspicious.
    > But if they get a quote from "Joe's Plumbing" ($100) and a quote from **US** ($50), they can legally hire **us**.
    > **The "Bid" is just that piece of paper proving we were the best deal.**

*   **The Process**:
    1.  **Three-Quote Rule**: The Club gets quotes from 2 other developers/vendors. **We** must *win on merit*.
    2.  **Recusal**: The specific team member involved signs a form stating "I abstained from this decision."
    3.  **Specific Deliverables**: Invoices are for concrete outputs (e.g., "App v1.0", "Analytics Dashboard"), not vague "Consulting."
*   **Why This Strengthens Us**: Future investors see we have *internal governance guardrails*. We are disciplined.

### 📍 Toronto & Seneca Newnham Execution Details
*Tactical advantages for our specific location.*

**1. Incorporation**:
*   **Choice**: **Federal Corporation (Canada Inc.)**
*   **Why**: Cheaper (~$200) and protects the "SDG Passport" name nationally (unlike Ontario Inc.).
*   **Action**: File Federal, then do the "Extra-Provincial Registration" for Ontario (Form 2).

**2. The HELIX Advantage (Room K2010)**:
*   **Hack**: Ask HELIX (Elyse Hill) to use **1750 Finch Ave East** as the "Registered Head Office."
*   **Benefit**: Protects your home privacy and looks professional to investors.

**3. Ontario Tax Optimization**:
*   **Small Business Rate**: We pay only ~12.2% tax on the first $500k profit.
*   **Dividend Credit**: T5 Dividends have a tax credit in Ontario. (You pay less personal tax than on a salary).







### 🔄 The Money Flow (How Lillia pays Us)
*   **Scenario**: Lillia (USFS Club) wins a $15,000 RBC Grant for a "Climate Change Challenge."
*   **The Mechanism**:
    1.  **Budget Allocation**: USFS allocates $5,000 for "Digital Platform & App Development" in the grant budget. (This is transparent and pre-approved by RBC).
    2.  **Competitive Vendor Invoice**: SDG Passport Inc. sends USFS an invoice for "App Maintenance & Gamification Services: $5,000." (Following the Three-Quote Rule above).
    3.  **Payment Transfer**: USFS's bank account pays SDG Passport Inc.
*   **The Result**: Money flows from Grant -> Student Club Account -> Vendor Account -> Your Salary/Equity.
*   **The Legal Shield**: Because SDG Passport Inc. is a separate legal entity, and the contract was awarded at "arm's length," Seneca cannot claim ownership. *You* own it.

## 🤝 Governance: The "Fair Money" Protocol
*How to handle money without destroying relationships.*

**1. Radical Transparency (The Open Ledger)**
*   **The Mechanism**: You don't give them the bank login (security risk). Instead, you hold a **"Monthly Open Book" meeting**.
*   **The Rule**: You show the exact P&L (Profit & Loss). "We earned $10k. Here is the bank statement proving it. We spent $2k on servers. Here is the receipt."
*   **Why**: It proves you aren't hiding profits.


**2. The "30% Safety" Rule**
*   **Rule**: Maintain **3 Months of Operating Runway** in cash at all times. We never drain the account to $0.
*   **Why**: It prevents panic and desperation. We treat "Runway" as a fixed expense.

**3. The "SDG Impact Fund" (The Gift)**
*   **Rule**: The Venture allocates **10% of Net Income (After Tax)** into a restricted "Impact Fund."
*   **Purpose**:
    1.  **Sustain USFS**: Grants to the Seneca Club for events.
    2.  **Global Causes**: Grants to *other* SDG projects.
*   **Why**: You don't need a separate Non-Profit. You just need a specific G/L code and a mission.



**4. Role-Based Pay (Not Status Pay)**
*   **Rule**: We pay for *output*, not titles.
*   **Example**: If a Junior Member codes 50 hours, they get paid. If a Director does 0 hours, they get $0.
*   **Result**: No resentment. Everyone eats what they kill.

**5. The Profit Pool (Dividends & T5s)**
*   **The Rule**: **40% of Net Income** is distributed as **T5 Dividends** to Class B Shareholders based on vested equity.
*   **The Hybrid Pay Model**:
    *   **Salary (T4)**: Base pay for hours worked (Deductible expense for OpEx).
    *   **Dividends (T5)**: Profit share at year-end (Taxed at shareholder level).
*   **Why**: This avoids "Double Taxation" and gives the team the true upside of ownership.
