# 🌍 SDG Passport: The Living Lab Platform
> *Powered by Hybrid Intelligence (Human + AI + RI)*

**"Converting Student Engagement into Operational Efficiency."**

This is the Core MVP for the **SDG Passport**—a "Living Lab" platform designed to transform the student body into a distributed **Data Collection Workforce**. By gamifying campus audits (waste, energy, accessibility), we solve critical operational data gaps (such as AASHE STARS EN-13) while providing students with verified impact micro-credentials.

**Status**: 🟢 Active Prototype | **Vision**: Smart Campus Operations Tool

- 🎯 **Stamp Collection**: Collect stamps by completing SDG-related actions
- 📷 **QR Scanner**: Simulated QR code scanning at campus booths
- 🏆 **Leaderboard**: Individual and program-level rankings
- 📚 **SDG Catalog**: Browse all 17 SDGs with available actions
- ✨ **PWA Ready**: Installable on mobile devices, works offline
