# 🎮 Business RPG Playbook: The Guild Master's Guide (Patch 1.2)

**Purpose:** This document translates boring business school theory into "Server Meta" mechanics. If you can lead a WOW Raid or manage a Discord server, you can run a corporation. (Proof that business class *should* have been this fun).

> [!CAUTION]
> **Legal Disclaimer:** This guide uses gaming metaphors to explain legal concepts. It is **NOT** legal advice. The "Server Rules" (Laws) change frequently. Always consult a "Guild Scribe" (Lawyer) or "Gold Goblin" (Accountant) before making major moves.

## 🌍 Chapter 2: Economics → "The Server Meta"
*   **The Concept:** The Economy is just the "Game Engine" rules.
*   **The Gig Economy:** **"Mercenary Mode."**
    *   *Meta:* Contractors grinding quests for Gold (Pay) and XP (Resume).
    *   **⚠️ CRA ASSESSMENT WARNING:** Do not misclassify Employees as Contractors (Mercenaries). 
        *   **The Multi-Factor Test:** To stay compliant, the Mods (CRA) check:
            1.  **Control:** Who calls the shots on *how* and *when* work is done?
            2.  **Tools:** Does the Mercenary use their own gear (Laptops/Software)?
            3.  **Profit/Risk:** Can the Mercenary lose money if the quest fails?
            4.  **Subcontracting:** Can they hire their own Alts to do the work?
            5.  **Integration:** Is the worker "part of the guild" or a separate service?
        *   **The Penalty:** If you fail the test, the CRA won't just ban you—they will **reassess** for unremitted **source deductions** (CPP/EI and tax), plus **penalties and interest**.

    *   **Ontario Meta:** Adhere to the *Digital Platform Workers' Rights Act*:
        *   **The Buff:** Guarantees minimum wage, right to tips, and **transparency on how pay is calculated.**
        *   **The Nerf:** Applies only to **"Engaged Time"** (Active Questing). Waiting for a quest (Lobby Time) is unpaid. Plan your burn rate accordingly!

### 📜 Quest Log: "The Uber-Guild Incident"
*   **The Lore:** A massive Transport Guild (Uber) tried to classify all its riders as "Mercenaries" (Contractors).
*   **The Event:** The "Ontario Supreme Court" (Game Admins) ruled that because the Guild controlled the app (Tools) and set the prices (Control), the riders were actually "NPC Employees."
*   **The Loot Drop:** This set the precedent for the new *Digital Platform Workers' Rights Act*. **Lesson:** You can't just call a duck a dragon and expect the Admins to believe you.

---

## ⚔️ Chapter 3: Global Markets → "Cross-Platform & Region Unlocking"
*   **The Concept:** Exporting is playing on foreign servers.
*   **The Nuance:** The UN SDGs are **"Optional DLC" / "Reputation Boost."**
    *   *Reality:* They are **Voluntary Guidelines**, NOT a mandatory legal patch for global trade.
    *   *The Buff:* They provide a **Reputation Boost** that unlocks "Legendary" funding and corporate partnerships, but they don't replace local server laws.

---

## 😇 Chapter 4: Ethics → "Clout Farming (The Karma System)"
*   **The Concept:** CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility).
*   **The Mechanic:** **"Reputation Farming."**
    *   *Canadian Meta:* CSR is usually **Voluntary** (unless you are a Mining Guild).
    *   *Why do it?* For **"Clout"** (Brand Equity).
    *   *Your Strat:* **SDG Labs** is your Clout Farm. It generates so much "Good Karma" that you unlock "Restricted Zones" (Grants/Partnerships) that For-Profit guilds cannot enter.

---

## 🛡️ Chapter 5: Ownership → "Character Classes"
*   **Sole Proprietor:** **"The Rogue."** High DPS (keep profit), but squishy (0% armor). One lawsuit = **Critical Hit.** It's not quite "Permadeath" (you can start over), but it's **"Hardcore Mode"**—creditors can loot your personal inventory (House/Car).
*   **Corporation:** **"The Paladin."** Heavy Armor (Liability Protection). Can tank damage. Moves slower due to "Admin Lag" (Annual Filings).
*   **The Hybrid:** **"Dual-Boxing."**
    *   You are playing **two characters at once**:
        1.  **Paladin (Corp):** Tanks the risk and captures profit.
        2.  **Cleric (Non-Profit):** Casts buffs (Grants) and heals the ecosystem.
    *   *Skill Check:* Requires high APM (Actions Per Minute) to manage strict separation of funds.

---

## 👑 Chapter 7: Leadership → "Raid Leading"
*   **The Concept:** Management.
*   **The Mechanic:** **"Shot Calling."**
    *   In Canada, Directors have **"Fiduciary Duty."**
    *   *The Wipe:* The Corporate Shield blocks most damage (Debts), **EXCEPT** for "Statutory Debts" (Unpaid Wages, HST, Payroll Deductions).
    *   *Direct Damage:* If the guild fails to pay the CRA or staff, the "Shield Breaks" and the Mods come for *you personally*.
    *   *Your Job:* Watch the "Cash Flow Timer."
    *   *Source:* [CRA Circular IC89-2 - Directors' Liability](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/ic89-2/director-s-liability.html)

---

## 🕸️ Chapter 8: Structure → "Guild Architecture"
*   **Hierarchy:** **"Pug Group."** Randoms shouting.
*   **Networked:** **"Core Static."**
    *   **Flexibility:** A member might be Main Tank today (Project Lead) but switches to Alt Healer tomorrow (Advisor). This leverages the "Gig Economy" meta effectively.

---

## 📣 Chapter 14: Marketing → "Aggro Management"
*   **The Concept:** Getting attention.
*   **The Mechanic:** **"AoE Taunt."**
    *   **B2B (New Meta):** Area of Effect (AoE) Taunt.
    *   *The Cast:* Drop a **"Hackathon Banner"** in the middle of the map.
    *   *The Effect:* It pulls aggro from **Students, Deans, and Corporate Sponsors** simultaneously. Much more efficient than single-target marketing.

---

## 🤝 Chapter 15: Partnerships → "Guild Alliances & Cross-Play"
*   **The Concept:** Strategic Alliances / Joint Ventures.
*   **The Mechanic:** **"Party Buffs."**
    *   **Solo Play:** Hard mode. You take all the agro, keep all the loot, but have 0 backups.
    *   **The Alliance:** Teaming up with another guild (Company) to clear a raid boss (Project) that neither could solo.
    *   *Types of Alliances:*
        1.  **Non-Equity Alliance:** **"The PUG (Pick-up Group)."** Just grouping for one quest. No shared bank.
        2.  **Equity Alliance:** **" shared Guild Bank."** Both guilds put Gold in a pot. High trust required.
        3.  **Joint Venture (JV):** **"Creating a Clan."** Two guilds spawn a *new*, separate entity to tackle a specific region.
    *   *The Risk:* **"Ninja Looting."** Without a signed "Party Charter" (Contract), the other guild might run off with the IP/Client List. Always set Loot Rules to "Master Looter" (Legal Agreement).

---

## 💀 Chapter 18: Risk → "Permadeath Prevention"
*   **The Concept:** Bankruptcy/Audit.
*   **The Mechanic:** **"Hardcore Mode."**
    *   **The Save Point:** Your **"Strategy Vault"** is your Save File.
    *   **Anti-Cheat:** Keeping 6 years of records is your proof to the Mods (CRA) that you aren't hacking.
    *   **Game Over:** Bankruptcy is a legal process, not just running out of gold. Avoid it by managing your "Burn Rate."

---
**Game On.** (Remember: Read the Patch Notes).

## 🕹️ Appendix: The Noob's Glossary
For those who don't speak "Gamer" (Audience Expansion Patch):

*   **Meta (Most Effective Tactic Available):** The current best strategy to win.
*   **Buff / Nerf:** "Buff" is a positive boost (e.g., getting a grant). "Nerf" is a negative change (e.g., higher taxes).
*   **DPS (Damage Per Second):** In business, this is your Revenue speed.
*   **Tank:** A character that takes damage so others remain safe. (The Corporation tanks liability).
*   **Permadeath:** Game Over with no restart. (Bankruptcy is *almost* this, but Hardcore Mode is more accurate).
*   **Aggro:** Attention. "Pulling Aggro" means getting noticed (Marketing).
*   **AoE (Area of Effect):** A spell that hits everyone in a circle, not just one target.
*   **NPC (Non-Player Character):** Employees without guild shares (Equity).
