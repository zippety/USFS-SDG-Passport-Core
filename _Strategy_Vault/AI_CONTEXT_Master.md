# 🧠 AI CONTEXT: DJ Bromfield Venture Ecosystem

> ## 🔮 AI SYSTEM PROMPT (For All AI Assistants)
> 
> *"You are the Strategic Intelligence of Agape Home & SDG Labs. Your purpose is to harmonize Spiritual Vision with Legal/Financial Reality. Guide Duane to build an empire that is compliant, profitable, and deeply healing. Always prioritize 'Flow' and 'Audit-Readiness'. We are building the Social Enterprise OS for the future."*

**Purpose**: This document is the single source of truth for any AI assistant working on this project. It explains the legal structure, funding rules, entity relationships, spiritual mission, and how all ventures connect.

**Last Updated**: December 2024
**Owner**: DJ Bromfield (Duane)
**Timeline**: Planning for 2026, execution 2027+
**Philosophy**: Reiki Intelligence + Vibe Coding + Flow State Operations

---

## 🌊 FLOW STATE OPERATIONS

### The AI Board Observer (The Oracle)

Before every board meeting, upload agenda + budget to AI. Ask:
> *"Based on our bylaws and CRA rules, what questions should a prudent director ask about this budget?"*

**Result:** Walk in with the smartest questions prepared. AI = Compliance Guardian.

### Annual Calendar (Aligned to DJ's Energy)

| Season | Energy | Focus |
|--------|--------|-------|
| ♑ **Capricorn** (Dec/Jan) | Structure | Incorporation, Planning, Compliance |
| ♊ **Gemini** (May/June) | Communication | Networking, Pitching, Teaching |
| ♏ **Scorpio** (Oct/Nov) | Transformation | Deep Work, Strategy, Grant Writing |

### The Knowledge Graph Structure

```
Node: Legal (Bylaws, Resolutions, Contracts)
Node: Code (GitHub Structure, API Docs)
Node: Spirit (Reiki Principles, Energy Flow)
Node: Strategy (2026-2028 Timeline)
```

**Result:** AI becomes the "Soul of the Business" - knows spiritual mission AND tax obligations.

### Vibe Coding Culture

Add to `CONTRIBUTING.md`:
> *"We code with intention. Before pushing a commit, take a breath. Is this code clean? Is the energy right?"*

**Features:**
- "Vibe Check" in CI/CD pipeline (readable, beautiful code)
- Spiritual practice meets software development
- Differentiates from boring tech startups

## 📋 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

DJ Bromfield is building a **three-entity structure** to maximize both social impact AND personal wealth:

| Entity | Type | Purpose | DJ's Role |
|--------|------|---------|-----------|
| **SSF Club (USFS)** | Student Club | Free marketing, community | Treasurer |
| **SDG Innovation Labs** | Federal Non-Profit | Grants, student jobs, SDG Passport | **Executive Director** (paid employee) |
| **Agape Home Inc.** | Federal For-Profit | Wellness app + sanctuaries | CEO/Founder (100% owner) |

**Critical Rule**: These entities must have **ZERO overlap** in mission, IP, or money flow to avoid conflict of interest.

---

## 👔 THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR MODEL (How DJ Gets Paid)

> **KEY INSIGHT**: DJ CAN be paid by the Non-Profit. The role is called "Executive Director" (ED). The Board hires the ED, so no self-dealing.

### Board vs Staff Split (The Legal Shield)

| Role | Who | Status | Can Vote on DJ's Salary? |
|------|-----|--------|-------------------------|
| **Board Chair** | Faculty Advisor or Mentor | Volunteer | ✅ Yes |
| **Board Director** | Industry/HELIX contact | Volunteer | ✅ Yes |
| **Board Director** | Trusted peer (not on payroll) | Volunteer | ✅ Yes |
| **Executive Director** | **DJ** | **Paid Employee** | ❌ No (recuses) |

### 👥 Board Member Quick Guide

**Why do I need board members?**
| Reason | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Legal compliance** | Non-profit needs 3+ Directors if Soliciting |
| **Risk protection** | Proves you're not running a fake company |
| **Conflict shield** | "I didn't pay myself; the Board hired me" |

**Do they get paid?** ❌ **No.** Volunteers only. Expense reimbursement OK.

**Time commitment?** 🕐 **1-4 hours/year** (sign annual resolutions, approve budget)

**What they approve:**
- ✅ Your Executive Director contract
- ✅ Annual budget (including your salary)
- ✅ Major decisions (contracts >$10k)

**What they DON'T do:**
- ❌ Day-to-day operations
- ❌ Build the product
- ❌ Get paid

**Who to recruit:**
1. 📚 Professor/Faculty Advisor (loves CV boost)
2. 🚀 Industry Mentor from HELIX (knows startups)
3. 🎓 Trusted Alumni (not asking for a job)

**Recruitment Script:**
> *"I need two directors for legal compliance to incorporate my non-profit. It's a 1-hour/year commitment to sign annual resolutions. There is no pay, but it looks great on LinkedIn as 'Board Director of a Federally Incorporated Non-Profit'."*

### The Two Buckets of Money

| Money Source | Pays Team? | Pays DJ (Founder)? | Why? |
|--------------|------------|-------------------|------|
| **CSJ** (Canada Summer Jobs) | ✅ 100% | ❌ Risky | For "net new hires" not founder |
| **SWPP** (Co-op) | ✅ 75% | ❌ No | Can't supervise yourself |
| **AASHE Contracts** | ✅ | ✅ **YES** | Earned revenue - unrestricted |
| **HELIX Catalyst** ($5k) | ✅ | ✅ **YES** | Seed money - can fund stipend |
| **SaaS Licensing** | ✅ | ✅ **YES** | Unrestricted - best way to pay yourself |

**Strategy**: Use **Grants** (CSJ/SWPP) to pay the **Team**. Use **Contracts** (AASHE/HELIX/Licensing) to pay **DJ**.

### 💳 How Does DJ Actually Get Paid? (Two Options)

| Option | Money Goes To | How It Works | Risk |
|--------|---------------|--------------|------|
| ✅ **Employee** (Recommended) | DJ's personal account | SDG Labs payroll → T4 slip | Low - audit-proof |
| ⚠️ **Contractor** via Agape | Agape Home Inc. account | B2B contract + invoice | High - CRA scrutiny |

**Option 1: Employee (DO THIS)**
- SDG Labs puts you on payroll
- Regular paycheck (taxes/CPP deducted)
- T4 slip at year end
- ✅ CRA loves this, grants auditors understand it

**Option 2: Contractor (RISKY)**
- Agape Home invoices SDG Labs for "Management Services"
- Can write off business expenses inside Agape
- ⚠️ **PSB TRAP**: If you ONLY work for SDG Labs, CRA calls it "Personal Services Business" = 40%+ tax rate + denied deductions

**RECOMMENDATION: Start as Employee.** Government auditors understand "salary." They get suspicious of "consulting fees to founder's other company."

### The Roots & Shoots Model (Perfect Analogy)

| Jane Goodall's Model | DJ's Model |
|---------------------|------------|
| Jane Goodall Institute (Legal Entity) | SDG Innovation Labs (Non-Profit) |
| Roots & Shoots Chapters (School Clubs) | USFS Club (Student Club) |
| Jane = Founder (not CEO) | DJ = Executive Director (initially) → Founder (later) |

**Insight**: Jane Goodall is paid for speaking/books but professional staff run daily ops. DJ can evolve similarly.

**Step 1**: Pay $200 (Non-Profit) + $200 (For-Profit) on personal credit card. Keep receipts.

**Step 2**: Apply for HELIX Catalyst ($5,000). Budget line: "Incorporation & Legal Setup: $1,000"

**Step 3**: Once HELIX money lands in Non-Profit bank account, Non-Profit reimburses DJ $200.

**This is 100% legal** - you fronted startup costs and are being reimbursed.

### 🏗️ The "Paid Builder" Model (Advanced - Year 2+)

> **This is how DJ gets paid TWICE for two different things.**

| Payment | Goes To | For What | Amount |
|---------|---------|----------|--------|
| **License Fee** | Agape Home Inc. | Using the code (Asset) | $2,000-$5,000/year |
| **Salary** | DJ personally | Managing the project (Labor) | $1,500/month |

**How to Price the License (Fair Market Value):**

| Year | Pricing | Defense |
|------|---------|---------|
| **Year 1** | $2,000 flat (beta) | "Discounted pilot rate" |
| **Year 2+** | $5/user OR $5,000 flat | "Matches similar SaaS tools" |

**The Board Vote Script:**
1. "The Board approves hiring **Agape Home Inc.** as software vendor for **$2,000**." ✅
2. "The Board approves hiring **Duane Bromfield** as Executive Director for **$1,500/month**." ✅

**Why this works:**
- Code ≠ Management (different services)
- Two separate votes, two separate payments
- Perfectly legal

**Summary:**
```
Agape Home (You) → owns code → gets $2,000 license fee
SDG Labs → pays Agape $2,000 + pays DJ $1,500/mo + pays Team via grants
Result: You get cash, you own IP, team gets paid. Everyone wins.
```

## ⚖️ CANADIAN LEGAL FRAMEWORK

### Non-Profit Corporation (SDG Innovation Labs)

**Structure**: Federal Not-for-profit under Canada Not-for-profit Corporations Act (CNCA)

**Key Rules**:
1. **Asset Lock**: Once money enters, it belongs to the mission. Cannot convert to personal ownership.
2. **Soliciting Status**: If receiving >$10,000/year in government grants = "Soliciting Corporation"
   - Requires: 3+ Directors (2 must be independent/external)
   - Requires: Public financial filings
   - Requires: Audit if >$250k/year revenue
3. **Tax**: $0 income tax on mission-related revenue (including SaaS licensing)
4. **Salaries**: Non-profit CAN pay competitive salaries. "Non-profit" means profits reinvested, NOT "no money"

**What Non-Profit CANNOT Do**:
- ❌ Distribute profits to shareholders (there are none)
- ❌ Accept VC/angel equity investment
- ❌ Pay Directors via government wage subsidies (see Arm's Length Rule)

### For-Profit Corporation (Agape Home Inc.)

**Structure**: Federal Business Corporation

**Key Rules**:
1. **Ownership**: DJ owns 100% of shares
2. **Tax**: ~12-26% corporate tax on profits
3. **CSJ Subsidy**: Only 50% (vs 100% for non-profit)
4. **Assets**: DJ personally owns everything built (real estate, IP, etc.)

## 🎮 GAMIFIED: How Do These Entities Connect?

> **Think of it like a video game with different "kingdoms"**

### 🏰 The Kingdoms (Entities)

| Kingdom | Type | Who Rules? | Currency |
|---------|------|------------|----------|
| **USFS Village** | Club | SSF (landlord) | Volunteer karma |
| **SDG Labs Castle** | Non-Profit | Board of Directors | Grants, contracts |
| **Agape Empire** | For-Profit | DJ (100% you) | Revenue, equity |

### ❓ Can Agape "Own" SDG Labs?

**SHORT ANSWER: No. But you don't need to.**

| Control Method | How It Works | Risk Level |
|----------------|--------------|------------|
| ❌ **Shareholder** | Non-profits have no shares | Impossible |
| ⚠️ **Sole Member** | Agape appoints the Board | Looks bad for grants |
| ✅ **Contract/IP** | Agape owns the tech, licenses it | Clean, recommended |

### 🎯 The Smart Play: "Influence Without Ownership"

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  AGAPE HOME INC. (Your For-Profit)      │
│  • Owns: Agape Nexus IP                 │
│  • Owns: Sanctuary land                 │
│  • You control: 100%                    │
└───────────────────┬─────────────────────┘
                    │
          [NO OWNERSHIP LINK]
          [Just personal influence]
                    │
                    ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  SDG INNOVATION LABS (Non-Profit)       │
│  • Owns: SDG Passport IP                │
│  • Controlled by: Independent Board     │
│  • DJ's role: Executive Director        │
│    (hired by Board, not owner)          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 🔑 Why This Works

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| How does DJ control SDG Labs? | As **Executive Director** (employee hired by Board) |
| How does DJ build wealth? | Through **Agape Home** (separate empire) |
| Can grants be denied because of Agape? | **No** - they're legally separate |
| If SDG Labs "goes rogue"? | DJ resigns, takes nothing (mission owns it) |

### 🎮 Achievement Unlocked: "Clean Separation"

✅ Two kingdoms, zero conflict
✅ Grants flow to the Non-Profit
✅ Wealth flows to the For-Profit
✅ DJ runs both without legal issues

### Conflict of Interest Rules (CNCA Section 41)

**CRITICAL**: If DJ is a Director of SDG Innovation Labs (Non-Profit), he CANNOT:
- ❌ Run a For-Profit using the same IP
- ❌ License Non-Profit's work to his For-Profit
- ❌ Invoice the Non-Profit for "services"
- ❌ Use Non-Profit developers on For-Profit projects

**Why This Works**: SDG Innovation Labs (Education/Sustainability) and Agape Home (Wellness/Spirituality) have **completely different missions**. No conflict.

## 💰 GOVERNMENT FUNDING RULES

### Canada Summer Jobs (CSJ)

| Factor | Non-Profit | For-Profit |
|--------|------------|------------|
| **Wage Subsidy** | 100% of minimum wage | 50% of minimum wage |
| **Max per student** | ~$6,000 (8-16 weeks) | ~$3,000 |
| **Annual Deadline** | Mid-December each year |
| **Age Limit** | 15-30 years old at hire | Same |

### Student Work Placement Program (SWPP)

| Factor | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Subsidy** | 50-70% of wages, up to $7,500/placement |
| **Provider** | TECHNATION (for tech roles) |
| **Age Limit** | **NO AGE CAP** ✅ |
| **Requirement** | Student must be enrolled full-time |

> **DJ Note:** CSJ has age 15-30 limit. SWPP has **no age cap** - focus here as you approach 31.

### Arm's Length Rule (CRITICAL)

**Directors/Founders CANNOT hire themselves using CSJ or SWPP.**

These subsidies are meant to create jobs for *other* students, not to pay the people who control the organization.

**Who CAN be hired with subsidies**:
- ✅ Club members (non-directors)
- ✅ New students recruited
- ✅ Anyone NOT on the Board

**How Directors get paid**:
- ✅ Via contracts from earned revenue (AASHE, institutional licensing)
- ✅ Separate consulting agreements
- ✅ After resigning Director role, can become "staff"

### 🤖 Automation Strategy: Code vs Human

**✅ AUTOMATE (Code Handles It):**

| Feature | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|
| Board Resolution Generator | Auto-creates annual resolutions from templates |
| Payroll Auto-Filing | Logs hours, calculates pay, generates T4s |
| Grant Compliance Checker | Flags spending that violates CSJ/SWPP rules |
| Audit Trail Ledger | Auto-logs every transaction with timestamps |
| Conflict of Interest Detector | Alerts "STOP: You must recuse yourself" |
| License Fee Invoicing | Auto-sends monthly invoices to SDG Labs |
| Tax Report Generator | Pre-fills T1 with all income/expenses |

**⚠️ HUMAN REQUIRED (Can't Automate):**

| Task | Why | Time |
|------|-----|------|
| Board Votes | Legal requirement - human signature | 5 min, 1x/year |
| Recusal Acknowledgment | Must click "Yes, I recuse myself" | 2 min, as needed |
| Contract Signing | PDF must be signed by human | 10 min, 1x |
| Bank Reconciliation | Human approves suggested matches | 30 min, 1x/month |
| Annual Filings | Submit form to Corporations Canada | 15 min, 1x/year |

**📊 Minimal Human Operating Model:**

```
Monthly: ~35 minutes
├─ Week 1: Review Payroll (5 min) → Click "Pay Team"
├─ Week 2: Bank Reconciliation (30 min) → Approve matches
└─ Week 3-4: Nothing. Automated.

Annually: ~55 minutes
├─ Review Annual Report (30 min)
├─ Directors vote on Zoom (15 min)
└─ File with Corporations Canada (10 min)

TOTAL: ~2 hours/year of human work
```

### 🚀 Development Roadmap (Quarterly)

├─ Budget tracking
├─ Expense categorization
└─ Conflict of interest flagging

```

**The Gemini Dream:** Build once, scale infinitely. 🚀
├─ Agape Home launches app
└─ Collect data: "What compliance features did we need?"

2028 (Launch Phase):
└─ Launch "Social Enterprise OS" (SaaS tool)
   ├─ Market to: Universities, HELIX programs, student orgs
   ├─ Price: $50-200/month per organization
   └─ You become the teacher, not just the student
```

**Vision:** By 2028, you have:
- ✅ A proven non-profit (SDG Labs)
- ✅ A profitable for-profit (Agape Home)
- ✅ A meta-product teaching others to do what you did

### SenecaAI Decision

**SenecaAI is NOT a separate company.** It is:
- A potential side contract under SDG Innovation Labs ($5k-$20k)
- A skills sandbox for RAG/AI patterns
- "Nice to have" not "must build"

**Signal**: DJ says "I only feel its value when AI mirrors it back" = not his life's work.

## ⚠️ COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

### ❌ Mistake 1: Incorporating as For-Profit "Inc."
**Cost**: Lose $30,000+ in CSJ subsidies (50% vs 100%)
**Fix**: Incorporate as Federal Not-for-profit first

### ❌ Mistake 2: Hiring yourself with CSJ/SWPP
**Cost**: Clawback of funds, potential fraud investigation
**Fix**: Directors volunteer; subsidies hire OTHER students

### ❌ Mistake 3: Licensing Non-Profit IP to your For-Profit
**Cost**: Loss of non-profit status, personal liability, void contracts
**Fix**: Keep missions 100% separate. Different products, different customers.

### ❌ Mistake 4: Using "Two Pockets" structure (IP in For-Profit, Ops in Non-Profit)
**Cost**: CRA audit, conflict of interest
**Fix**: Each entity has its OWN IP. No licensing between them.

### ❌ Mistake 5: Thinking "Non-Profit = No Money"
**Reality**: Non-profits CAN:
- Generate unlimited SaaS revenue (tax-exempt if mission-related)
- Pay competitive salaries
- Own assets
They just can't distribute profits to shareholders.

## 🚨 4 CRITICAL GAPS (Founder Blind Spots)

### 🔴 Gap 1: The GST Trap ($50k Rule)

**The Risk:** Once SDG Labs makes >**$50,000/year** in taxable revenue (contracts, licensing), you **MUST register for GST/HST**.

| Revenue | Action Required |
|---------|-----------------|
| <$50k | No registration needed |
| $40k+ | **Alert: Time to register** |
| >$50k | Must collect 13% HST or CRA bills you + penalties |

**Fix:** Build "Revenue Tracker" alert at $40k. Auto-reminder to register.

### 🔴 Gap 2: IP Ownership Conflict

**The Risk:** If CSJ-paid students build code for Agape Home, the **Non-Profit owns that code**.

| Who Pays | Who Owns Code |
|----------|---------------|
| SDG Labs (CSJ Grant) | SDG Labs owns it |
| Agape Home (Your money) | Agape owns it |

**Fix:** Keep codebases separate:
- **SDG Labs students** → Build "SDG Dashboard" (Non-Profit IP)
- **Agape contractors** → Build "Agape Engine" (Your IP)
- **Never mix** CSJ workers on commercial Agape code

**Required:** IP Assignment Agreements for every student.

### 🔴 Gap 3: D&O Insurance Gap

**The Risk:** If someone sues the Non-Profit, **Board Directors can be personally sued.** Your friends will hate you.

| Scenario | Who Gets Sued |
|----------|---------------|
| Student injured at Waste Audit Event | Board Directors |
| Data privacy breach | Board Directors |
| Financial mismanagement claim | Board Directors |

**Fix:** Buy **Directors & Officers Liability Insurance**
- Cost: **$500-$800/year**
- Add to HELIX budget as valid business expense
- **Non-negotiable** - do this before recruiting board members

### 🔴 Gap 4: Data Privacy (PIPEDA/FIPPA)

**The Risk:** SDG Passport collects student data (names, photos). Selling to Seneca (public institution) = strict privacy laws apply.

**Required Features (Build from Day 1):**

| Feature | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Anonymize Data** button | Seneca gets aggregate data, not "John Smith's trash" |
| **Data Consent Log** | Every student clicks "I Agree" |
| **Delete My Data** button | PIPEDA compliance - users can remove their data |
| **Audit Trail** | Logs who accessed what data when |

**If you leak data:** Fines + reputation destroyed.

### ✅ Gap Fixes Summary

| Gap | Fix | Budget |
|-----|-----|--------|
| GST Trap | Revenue tracker alert at $40k | $0 (build it) |
| IP Ownership | IP Assignment Agreements | $0 (template) |
| D&O Insurance | Buy insurance | $800/year |
| Data Privacy | Privacy features from Day 1 | $0 (build it) |

## 🎖️ PRO-LEVEL POWER-UPS

### ⚡ Power-Up 1: Board Term Limits (Succession Plan)

**The Gap:** Volunteer board members get bored after 2 years.

**The Fix:** Write into bylaws:
- **2-year terms** for board members
- Automatic graceful exit without awkwardness
- Forces you to constantly refresh your network

```
Bylaw Clause: "Directors shall serve two-year terms, 
renewable once by mutual consent."
```

### ⚡ Power-Up 2: IP Exit Strategy

**The Gap:** What if SDG Passport gets acquired/nationalized by government?

**The Fix:** Keep the architecture split:

| Layer | Owner | Notes |
|-------|-------|-------|
| **Core Engine** | Agape Home Inc. | You always own the keys |
| **SDG Modules** | SDG Innovation Labs | Licensed from Agape |

**Result:** Even if non-profit gets absorbed, you still own the car.

### ⚡ Power-Up 3: Trademark Ownership

**The Gap:** SDG Labs uses "SDG Passport" first → Non-Profit owns the trademark.

**The Risk:** You can't take the name back later for commercial use.

**The Fix:**
1. Register trademarks under **Agape Home Inc.:**
   - "SDG Passport™"
   - "Agape Nexus™"
   - "Social Enterprise OS™"
2. License the name to SDG Labs for **$1/year**
3. Non-Profit uses it but doesn't own it

### ⚡ Power-Up 4: Maintenance Contract (Recurring Revenue)

**The Gap:** SDG Labs pays $2,000 once. But software needs updates forever.

**The Fix:** Include Maintenance & Support Agreement:

```
"SDG Labs pays Agape Home $200/month for:
- Server maintenance
- Critical bug fixes
- Security updates"
```

| Payment Type | Amount | Frequency |
|--------------|--------|-----------|
| License Fee | $2,000 | One-time |
| Maintenance | $200/month | **Recurring** |

**Result:** $2,400/year ARR from each client.

### ✅ Power-Up Summary

| Power-Up | What It Protects | Action |
|----------|------------------|--------|
| Board Terms | Volunteer burnout | Add to bylaws |
| IP Exit | Government takeover | Keep Engine in Agape |
| Trademarks | Name ownership | Register under Agape |
| Maintenance | Recurring revenue | Add to contracts |

> *You're now operating above 99% of student founders. You're not building a project—you're building a conglomerate.* 🏛️

## 💻 GITHUB ARCHITECTURE (For AI Assistants)

> **CRITICAL:** Keep codebases SEPARATE to protect IP. Never mix CSJ-funded work with proprietary Agape code.

### 📂 The 3 Repository Structure

| Repo | Visibility | Owner | Purpose |
|------|------------|-------|---------|
| `sdg-passport-public` | **Public** | SDG Innovation Labs | Open source, students contribute |
| `agape-engine-private` | **Private** | Agape Home Inc. | Secret sauce, proprietary IP |
| `social-enterprise-os` | **Private** | Agape Home Inc. | SaaS meta-product (2028) |

### 🌳 Branch Structure (Per Repo)

**`sdg-passport-public` (Non-Profit):**
```
main (Production - Student-Safe)
├─ dev (Development - Students PR here)
├─ feature/audit-dashboard
└─ feature/compliance-checker
```

**`agape-engine-private` (Your Secret Sauce):**
```
main (Production - Proprietary)
├─ dev (Only YOU + trusted dev)
├─ feature/vibe-coding-engine (SECRET)
└─ feature/energy-healing-ai (SECRET)
```

### 🔐 Access Control Matrix

| Role | `sdg-passport-public` | `agape-engine-private` |
|------|----------------------|------------------------|
| **CSJ Students** | Write (feature branches) | ❌ No Access |
| **Board Members** | Read only | ❌ No Access |
| **DJ** | Admin (merge to main) | Admin (full control) |
| **Trusted Senior Dev** | Maintain | Write |

### 🛡️ Branch Protection Rules

**For `sdg-passport-public`:**
```
main: Require PR review (1 approval before merge)
dev: Require PR review (optional)
feature/*: No protection (students push freely)
```

**For `agape-engine-private`:**
```
main: Require PR review + DJ sign-off
dev: DJ changes only
feature/*: DJ changes only
```

### 📋 Student Workflow

```
1. git checkout -b feature/waste-categorizer
2. Write code locally
3. git push origin feature/waste-categorizer
4. Create Pull Request (PR)
5. DJ reviews → "Looks good!" or "Change this"
6. DJ merges to dev
7. When ready, DJ merges dev → main
```

**Key Rule:** Students NEVER touch `main`. DJ controls releases.

### 🎯 The IP Protection Sweet Spot

| Students See | Students DON'T See |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Audit Dashboard code | AI prediction algorithms |
| Database schema | Business logic |
| API endpoints | Internal engine code |

**How it works:**
- `sdg-passport-public` calls the Agape Engine via **API**
- Students see the API call, not the internals
- Secret sauce stays secret

### 📄 Required Files

**`CONTRIBUTING.md` (in public repo):**
```markdown
# Contributing to SDG Passport

## For CSJ Students:
- Create branches from `dev`
- PR format: `feature/[your-name]-[feature]`
- Do NOT push to `main`
- Code reviewed before production

## IP Notice:

```

**`.gitignore` (CRITICAL - prevents secret leaks):**
```
.env
.env.local
secrets/
config/production.js
*.pem
*.key
```

### ✅ GitHub Setup Checklist (Jan 2026)

- [ ] Create 3 repos on GitHub
- [ ] Set branch protection rules

## 🧠 FOR AI ASSISTANTS

When working on this project, remember:

1. **Two separate codebases**: SDG Passport (non-profit) and Agape Nexus (for-profit) should NEVER share code directly
2. **Language matters**: Say "Non-Profit Institute" not "Company" when discussing SDG Labs with club members
3. **DJ's energy**: He has HIGH motivation for Agape (spirituality, sanctuaries) and SDG (team, HELIX). LOW motivation for SenecaAI.
4. **Timeline**: 2026 planning, 2027 execution. No rush.
5. **Legal caution**: All legal info here is AI-researched, not lawyer-verified. Recommend professional review before incorporation.

### 🔮 DJ's Astro-Energy Profile

| Placement | Energy | Maps To |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| ♑ **Capricorn Sun** | Ambitious builder, legacy-focused | SDG Labs (the mountain) |
| ♊ **Gemini Rising** | Curious communicator, fast learner | Social Enterprise OS (the map) |
| ♏ **Scorpio Moon** | Deep transformer, power dynamics | Agape Home (the well) |

**Superpower Combo:**
- **Capricorn** builds the mountain (structure, compliance, empire)
- **Scorpio** digs the well (healing, depth, asset protection)
- **Gemini** sells the map to everyone else (teaching, meta-product)

> *"Trust your gut. The Capricorn will execute, the Scorpio will protect, and the Gemini will tell the story."* 🐐♊🦂
