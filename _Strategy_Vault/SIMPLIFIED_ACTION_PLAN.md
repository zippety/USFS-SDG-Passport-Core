## 1. THE "WAGE STACK" MANEUVER (Financial)
*We do not ask for "budget." We ask for "matching funds."*

*   **Step A: Incorporate ("The Vessel")**
    *   [ ] **Action:** Register **"SDG Innovation Labs Inc."** (or Non-Profit structure) via HELIX.
    *   *Why:* You cannot apply for SWPP (Student Grants) without a CRA Business Number.

*   **Step B: The "Summer Camp" Play (CSJ)**
    *   [ ] **Action:** Apply for **Canada Summer Jobs** in January.
    *   *Pitch:* "We are hiring 10 students to run a specialized 'Sustainability Data Camp' for the college."
    *   *Goal:* 100% Wage coverage for Summer 2026.

*   **Step C: The "Co-op" Play (SWPP)**
    *   [ ] **Action:** Create job descriptions for "React Developer" and "Data Analyst."
    *   *Goal:* Be ready to apply for TECHNATION funding (75% subsidy) the moment incorporation is done.

## 2. THE "SMART CAMPUS" PILOT (Product)
*We stop selling "fun." We sell "data."*

*   **The Pilot Pitch (to Sustainability Office):**
    *   "We are running a **Living Lab Pilot** to collect AASHE STARS EN-1 data."
    *   "Cost: **$500** for the semester (Server costs)."
    *   "Deliverable: A CSV file of every student action, sorted by SDG."

*   **The "Trojan Horse":**
    *   Once they pay $500, they are a "Client."
    *   Once they are a Client, we can upsell the "Dashboard License" ($10k/year) later.

## 3. THE "EXECUTIVE" BRAND (Marketing)
*We launch as a legitimate campus institution.*

*   **Social Strategy:**
    *   **Post 1:** "Official Launch: The USFS Smart Campus Initiative." (Professional graphic).
    *   **Post 2:** "Now Hiring: Student Researchers." (Links to the Co-op page).
    *   **Tone:** "We are building the future of the campus. Join us." (Not "Look at our cute pet").

## 4. IMMEDIATE "NEXT MONDAY" TASKS

*   [ ] **Update LinkedIn:** Change your title to **"SDG Creative Director | Building Smart Campus Infrastructure"**.
*   [ ] **Print the One-Pager:** Bring the `Master_Funding_List.md` to the exec meeting.
