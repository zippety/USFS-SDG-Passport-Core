# ⚔️ The Tandem Operational Model: The "Trojan Horse" Strategy

**Purpose:** This document defines the "Rules of Engagement" for the three-entity ecosystem. It acts as the firewall to prevent conflict of interest while ensuring operational synergy.

## 🏗️ The "Tandem" Operational Model

Your three entities—**USFS Club** (The Face), **SDG Labs** (The Credibility), and **Agape Home** (The Engine)—act like a **trojan horse system** where one opens the door for the other.

They "flow together" by solving different problems for different people:
1.  **USFS (Club)** solves the "Community & Engagement" problem for students.
2.  **SDG Labs (Non-Profit)** solves the "Trust & Mission" problem for universities/grantors.
3.  **Agape Home (For-Profit)** solves the "Scale & Tech" problem for investors/customers.

## 1. The Interaction: Who Talks to Whom?

This table is your "Rules of Engagement." When you walk into a room, you need to know which "hat" you are wearing.

| **The Audience** | **Who You Are** | **The Pitch** | **Why?** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Seneca Admin / SSF** | **USFS Club** | "We are a student club running a sustainability challenge." | Schools trust clubs. They fear companies trying to sell them things. |
| **Grant Agencies / Gov** | **SDG Labs** | "We are a non-profit researching student behavior on SDGs." | They only give money to non-profits/charities. |
| **Investors / Customers** | **Agape Home** | "We built a SaaS platform that gamifies sustainability." | They want ROI and equity, which only a for-profit offers. |
| **Students (Users)** | **USFS Club** | "Come to our pizza party!" | Students ignore "corporate" events but join "club" parties. |

## 2. The "Symbiotic Loop" (The Flow)

This is the operational cycle of how money, data, and users flow between them.

### Step 1: The "Trojan Horse" (Engagement)
*   **Action:** USFS Club hosts an "SDG Gamification Hackathon" or "Wellness Challenge" on campus.
*   **Funding:** USFS applies for SSF club funding ($200–$500) or Service Corps grants (via SDG Labs) to buy pizza and prizes.
*   **The Hook:** To participate, students must download the **"SDG Passport"** app (built by Agape Home).

### Step 2: The "Validation" (Data)
*   **Action:** 100 students use the app for a month.
*   **Benefit to SDG Labs:** You get a report saying, "We engaged 100 youth in SDG action." (Great for grant reports).
*   **Benefit to Agape Home:** You get 100 beta testers, bug reports, and user data to prove to investors that "students love this."

### Step 3: The "Upsell" (Revenue)
*   **Action:** You take the report from Step 2 to the Seneca Dean or a corporate sponsor.
*   **The Pitch:** "Look, 500 students are already tracking their carbon footprint. You (the School) should buy the **Administrator Dashboard** to see this data live."
*   **The Sale:** **Agape Home** sells the dashboard license to the school.

## 3. Avoiding "Self-Dealing" (The Firewall)

To keep this "flow" legal, you must respect the boundaries:

### Rule 1: USFS Club is NOT your Company
*   **The Law:** The club cannot *buy* your software. It should get it for **free**.
*   **Why?** SSF rules strictly forbid clubs from "entering contracts" or "generating personal gain" for executives. If you try to sell your app to your own club, the SSF will shut you down.
*   **Correct Flow:** Agape Home *donates* the license to USFS. The "payment" is the exposure and user testing, not cash.

### Rule 2: SDG Labs is the "Fiscal Sponsor"
*   If USFS wants to apply for a big grant (e.g., $5,000) but lacks the legal status, **SDG Labs** acts as the partner.
*   **Flow:** SDG Labs receives the money -> buys supplies/food -> USFS hosts the event.

## 4. Example: The "Wellness" Campaign

*   **Theme:** "Exam Stress Relief Week"
*   **USFS Club:** Books the room, puts up posters, invites students to "Learn to meditate."
*   **SDG Labs:** Provides the "curriculum" or "methodology" (branding it as mental health education).
*   **Agape Home:** Provides the **Nexus** game/app. Students play the game to learn the breathing techniques.
*   **Result:** 
    *   Students get relief (**USFS wins**)
    *   SDG Labs gets impact stats (**Non-profit wins**)
    *   Agape Home gets user retention data (**For-profit wins**)

## ✅ Summary Strategy
1.  **Use USFS to get *people*.** (Free marketing).
2.  **Use SDG Labs to get *grants*.** (Free R&D money).
3.  **Use Agape Home to get *profit*.** (Sells the result to institutions).
