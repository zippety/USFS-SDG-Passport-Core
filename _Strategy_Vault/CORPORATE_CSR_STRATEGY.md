# 🚀 Corporate CSR Strategy: The "Talent Pipeline" Protocol

**Purpose:** This document documents the strategic pivot from asking schools for small money to offering high-value "Talent Pipeline" partnerships to Robotics, Space, and Defense corporations.

---

## 🎯 The Core Thesis: "Money Follows Talent"
Schools are broke. But **Robotics, Space, and Defense companies** are desperate for future engineers and have massive "Corporate Social Responsibility" (CSR) budgets they *must* spend.

We stop selling "Wellness." We start selling **"Access to the Best Student Engineers."**

---

## 🔫 The Hit List (Who to Pitch)
Instead of the Dean, we target the **Director of University Relations** or **CSR Manager** at:

| Company | Sector | Why Them? | Location |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **MDA Space** | Space/Defense | Builds the Canadarm. Needs system engineers. | Brampton HQ |
| **Magna Int.** | Auto/Robotics | Massive R&D budget for autonomous systems. | Aurora HQ |
| **Thales** | Defense/Transit | Huge need for secure, sustainable tech talent. | Toronto |
| **Canadensys** | Aerospace | Building lunar rovers. Needs "Space + Earth" narrative. | Bolton, ON |
