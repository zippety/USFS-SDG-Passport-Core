# 💰 Financial Compliance Strategy: The "Indirect Payment" Protocol

**Purpose:** This document defines the compliant financial pathways for DJ Bromfield to extract value from the ecosystem without violating Ontario's strict director compensation rules.

---

## 🚨 The Golden Rule
**Focus on paying yourself another way.**

Charging your own non-profit small amounts (e.g., $500/month) is **not worth the legal headache**. In Ontario, paying a director *anything* directly requires strict independent votes or even court orders.
*   **Verdict:** Keep the software license at **$1 (or free)**.
*   **Strategy:** Use the **"Indirect Payment"** Strategy instead.

## 🏗️ Option 1: The "Indirect Payment" Strategy (Recommended)
**Concept:** Instead of squeezing cash out of the non-profit (which has no money), use the non-profit to **get money for your For-Profit** from *third parties*.

### How it works:
1.  **The Grant:** SDG Labs (Non-Profit) applies for a grant (e.g., $10k) to run a "Digital Sustainability Workshop."
2.  **The Budget:** The budget includes a rigid line item for "Specialized Facilitation" or "Technical Platform Rental" (allowed expenses).
3.  **The Vendor:** You do *not* hire yourself personally. You hire **Agape Home** (your corporation) as the vendor.
4.  **The Safeguard:** You (Director) **leave the room**. The *other* board members vote to hire Agape Home because "it is the only platform that offers this specific gamification service."
5.  **The Result:** The grant pays Agape Home. Agape Home pays you a salary.

## 🔮 Option 2: The "Salary Splitting" Model (Future State)
**Concept:** If SDG Labs scales enough to hire staff, you can maximize income by bifurcating your role.

### How it works:
1.  **The Resignation:** You **resign from the Board of Directors**. You cannot be your own boss.
2.  **The Hire:** The Board hires you as the **Executive Director (ED)**.
3.  **The Status:** You are now an *employee*, not a *director*. Employees can be paid a fair salary (e.g., $60k/year).
4.  **The Ownership:** You retain 100% ownership of **Agape Home Inc.** on the side.
5.  **The Result:** You collect a salary from the Non-Profit (as ED) AND profits from the For-Profit (as Owner).

## ⚠️ The "Quotes Method" Trap
**Why not just get 3 quotes and charge the lowest?**
*   **The Risk:** Even if you charge "fair market value," as a Director in Ontario, you fall under the *Charities Accounting Act*.
*   **The Consequence:** Unless your bylaws specifically allow it AND you have 4+ independent directors voting, you could be forced to repay 100% of the money + penalties.
*   **Verdict:** NOT worth the risk for small fees.

## ✅ Best Path Forward (Summary)

| **Entity** | **Your Role** | **Financial Action** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **SDG Labs** (Non-Profit) | **Director (Volunteer)** | **Do NOT take salary.** Give software for free ($1). Use it to win grants. |
| **Agape Home** (For-Profit) | **CEO / Owner** | **Take 100% of profit.** Charge *external* schools/companies full price. |
| **The Payout** | **Contractor** | When SDG Labs wins a grant that *needs* tech, hire Agape Home for a specific project. Recuse yourself from the vote. |
