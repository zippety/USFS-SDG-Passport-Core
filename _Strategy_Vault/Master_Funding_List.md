# 💰 Master Funding Opportunities & Strategy List

> [!CAUTION]
> **CRITICAL**: Must incorporate as **Federal Non-Profit** to get 100% CSJ subsidy. For-Profit gets only 50%.

**Objective:** Secure sustainable funding for the SDG Passport "Living Lab" platform.
**Target Operating Budget:** **$285,000/year**
*   **Goal:** 10 Staff @ **$28,500/year** (The "Benefit Maximization" Salary).
*   **Strategy:** "Wage Stacking" (Gov. Subsidies + Corporate Grants).

> **Why $28,500?** This is the **Ontario "Sweet Spot."** It stays under the $28,506 threshold for full **Ontario Trillium Benefits** and maximizes the **Canada Workers Benefit (CWB)** phase-out. Going higher starts reducing government aid. We pay "Strategic Living Wages."

## 🏆 The "Cheat Code": Wage Subsidies (Priority #1)
*How to get the Government to pay 75% - 100% of our salaries.*

> [!WARNING]
> **Arm's Length Rule**: Directors/Founders **CANNOT** be hired using SWPP/CSJ. Use these to hire *other students* (club members, new recruits). Directors get paid via AASHE contracts.

### 1. **Canada Summer Jobs (CSJ)**
*   **Funding:** **100% of Minimum Wage** (for ~8-16 weeks in summer) - **IF Non-Profit**
*   **Potential Value:** ~$6,000 per student x 10 students = **$60,000**.
*   **Requirement:** ⚠️ **Non-Profit Corporation** (For-profit gets only 50%)
*   **Who Can Be Hired:** Club members, new students - **NOT Directors**
*   **Strategy:** Hire club members (not exec team) as "SDG Living Lab Ambassadors"

### 2. **Student Work Placement Program (SWPP)**
*   **Funding:** **50% - 75% of Salary** (up to $7,500 per semester).
*   **Potential Value:** $7,500 x 5 Co-op Students = **$37,500 per semester**.
*   **Providers:** TECHNATION (Tech roles), Magnet (General), ECO Canada (Environmental).
*   **Who Can Be Hired:** Students on co-op - **NOT organization Directors**
*   **Strategy:** Register as "Tech Employer". Hire students for dev/marketing roles.

## 🏦 Corporate Partnerships (The "Big Money")

### 3. **RBC Future Launch**
*   **Focus:** "Helping young people gain skills for the future of work."
*   **Potential Grant:** **$25,000 - $50,000**.
*   **The Pitch:** "We are a student-run 'Work Integrated Learning' lab. We don't just build an app; we train students in React, AI, and Sustainability."

### 4. **TD Ready Commitment**
*   **Focus:** "Vibrant Planet" (Environment) and "Connected Communities".
*   **Potential Grant:** **$10,000 - $30,000**.
*   **The Pitch:** "The SDG Passport is a digital infrastructure for a greener, more connected campus community."

## 🏛️ Institutional Contracts (The "Bread & Butter")

### 5. **Office of Sustainability (AASHE Service Contract)**
*   **Value:** **$2,500/semester** (upgraded from pilot).
*   **Product:** Audit-proof data for AASHE STARS Credit EN-1.
*   **Role:** Funds AASHE contract work for Directors; covers overhead.

### 6. **Seneca HELIX (Catalyst Fund)**
*   **Value:** **$5,000 (One-Time)**.
*   **Role:** Seed money for "Market Validation" (Marketing Blitz).

## 💰 SaaS Revenue Stream (The "Independence Engine")

> [!TIP]
> **Non-profits CAN sell software.** This is mission-related revenue (advancing sustainability education) and is **tax-exempt**.

### SaaS Licensing Tiers
| Tier | Target Market | Annual License | Notes |
|------|---------------|----------------|-------|
| **Tier 1** | Small colleges (<5k students) | **$5,000-$8,000** | Starter package |
| **Tier 2** | Medium colleges (Seneca-size) | **$10,000-$15,000** | Full platform |
| **Tier 3** | Large universities | **$20,000-$30,000** | Enterprise + Support |

**Projection:**
- Year 2-3: 3-5 clients = **$40,000-$75,000/year**
- Year 3+: 10-15 clients = **$150,000-$225,000/year** (70% of operating budget)
