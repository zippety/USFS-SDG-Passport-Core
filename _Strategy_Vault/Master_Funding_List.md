# 💰 Master Funding Opportunities & Strategy List

**Objective:** Secure sustainable funding for the SDG Passport "Living Lab" platform.
**Target Operating Budget:** **$285,000/year**
*   **Goal:** 10 Staff @ **$28,500/year** (The "Benefit Maximization" Salary).
*   **Strategy:** "Wage Stacking" (Gov. Subsidies + Corporate Grants).

> **Why $28,500?** This is the **Ontario "Sweet Spot."** It stays under the $28,506 threshold for full **Ontario Trillium Benefits** and maximizes the **Canada Workers Benefit (CWB)** phase-out. Going higher starts reducing government aid. We pay "Strategic Living Wages."

## 🏆 The "Cheat Code": Wage Subsidies (Priority #1)
*How to get the Government to pay 75% - 100% of our salaries.*

### 1. **Canada Summer Jobs (CSJ)**
*   **Funding:** **100% of Minimum Wage** (for ~8-16 weeks in summer).
*   **Potential Value:** ~$6,000 per student x 10 students = **$60,000**.
*   **Requirement:** Incorporated Non-Profit or Public Sector.
*   **Strategy:** Hire the entire executive team as "Summer Camp Counselors" for the "SDG Living Lab Camp."

### 2. **Student Work Placement Program (SWPP)**
*   **Funding:** **50% - 75% of Salary** (up to $7,500 per semester).
*   **Potential Value:** $7,500 x 5 Co-op Students = **$37,500 per semester**.
*   **Providers:** TECHNATION (Tech roles), Magnet (General), ECO Canada (Environmental).
*   **Strategy:** Register SDG Passport as a "Tech Employer". Hire students (even our own team members) as formal Co-op placements.

*   **The Pitch:** "We are a student-run 'Work Integrated Learning' lab. We don't just build an app; we train students in React, AI, and Sustainability."

### 4. **TD Ready Commitment**
