## 🎯 The Magic Number: ~$26,000 / Year
**Why this exact number?**
Earning ~$26,000 is the peak efficiency point for maximizing the **Canada Workers Benefit (CWB)** before the clawback accelerates.

**The "Stack" (Annual Estimate):**
1.  **Salary:** ~$26,000 (Taxable)
2.  **CWB (Canada Workers Benefit):** +$1,428 (Max Estimate)
3.  **Trillium Benefit:** +$1,000+ (Tax Free)
4.  **GST/HST Credit:** +$519 (Tax Free)
5.  **Effective Net Income:** **~$28,000+** (with almost $0 income tax paid).

**Compare to $60k Salary:**
*   At $60k, you pay ~$13.5k in tax indices. You lose ALL the benefits above.
*   **Net Result:** You work twice as hard for minimal net gain.

## 🏗️ The Strategy: "Salary + Assets" (No Dividends)

### 1. The Salary Base ($26,000)
*   **Action:** Pay yourself strictly **$2,166 / month**.
*   **Why:** You need employment income to generate RRSP room and qualify for CWB.
*   **Important:** Avoid dividends if possible.
    *   *Trap:* Dividends are "grossed up" by 15% when calculating benefit eligibility. A $5k dividend looks like $5,750 income to the CRA, killing your Trillium/CWB benefits faster than salary.

### 2. Corporate Asset Usage (Safe) vs. Expensing (Dangerous)
*   **❌ The Trap (Expensing):** Paying for your personal rent or personal meals on the company card.
    *   *Result:* CRA charges "Double Tax" + 50% Penalties.
*   **✅ The Fix (Assets):** The Corporation **buys and owns** the tools you use.
    *   **Laptop/iPad:** Bought by Agape Home. You use it for work.
    *   **Phone/Internet:** Paid by Agape Home (Allowed if primarily for business).
    *   **Cars/Travel:** Do NOT buy a personal car in the corp. Pay per km for specific business trips.

### 3. The "Health Hack" (PHSP)
*   **Action:** Set up a **Private Health Services Plan (PHSP)** for the Corporation.
*   **The Benefit:** The Corp pays for your dentist, glasses, and drugs.
    *   Corp gets a **100% Tax Deduction**.
    *   You get a **0% Taxable Benefit**.
*   **Value:** Effectively adds $2k-$5k of tax-free "salary" to your life.

## 🏦 The "Corporate Vault" (Retained Earnings)
**Scenario:** You have $50k profit. You only need $26k to live.
*   **Action:** Leave the remaining $24k in the Corporation.
*   **Tax Rate:** It is taxed at only **12.2%** (Small Business Rate).
*   **Invest:** Open a corporate brokerage account to invest that capital. It grows faster than if you pulled it out and paid personal tax.

## ✅ Summary Checklist
