# Seneca Defense Strategy: Overcoming the "Blockers"
**"How to Turn Red Tape into a Red Carpet"**

## 🚨 The Situation
You have built a tool the students love (The App).
But the "Group of Nine" (Execs) are worried about **Bureaucracy**:
1.  *"Seneca won't let the club pay a business."*
2.  *"You need to be incorporated."*
3.  *"Why would Seneca care?"*

**This document provides the specific answers, names, and moves to solve this.**

## 🔐 Blocker 1: "Seneca won't let the Club pay a student business."
**The Fear**: Conflict of Interest. (Promoting a student's side hustle).
**The Solution**: **Become a HELIX Venture.**

*   **The Logic**: Seneca has an incubator called **HELIX** (Health Entrepreneurship and Lifestyle Innovation Xchange).
*   **The Loophole**: When you join HELIX, you satisfy the "Incorporation" requirement (they help you do it) and you become a "Campus-Incubated Vendor."
*   **The Pitch to Execs**: "We aren't just 'some vendor.' We are a generic Seneca HELIX Venture. Supporting us supports Seneca's own innovation metrics."

### 👤 Who to Talk To (The Action)
*   **Person**: **Chris Dudley** (Director, HELIX) or **Elyse Hill**.
*   **The Ask**: "We have a student-built app for the Office of Sustainability. We need to incorporate so we can legally accept payments/grants. Can HELIX help us structure this?"

## 🏢 Blocker 2: "Why would Seneca let the Club invest in this?"
**The Fear**: It's a waste of student money.
**The Solution**: **AASHE STARS Reporting.**

*   **The Secret**: Every college competes in the **AASHE STARS** (Sustainability Tracking, Assessment & Rating System). It is the "Olympic Gold Medal" for colleges.
*   **The Problem Seneca Has**: They lose points because they cannot *prove* student engagement. They have events, but no hard data.
*   **The Pitch**: "This app gives Seneca the **audit-proof data** they need to raise their STARS Ranking. We are selling them the 'Gold Medal', not just an app."

### 👤 Who to Talk To
*   **Person**: **Director of the Office of Sustainability** (or the Sustainability Manager).
*   **The Ask**: "Do you struggle to collect engagement data for AASHE STARS credit EN-1 (Student Educators)? Our app automates that collection for you."

## 💼 Blocker 3: "You need to be Incorporated"
**The Fear**: Liability.
**The Solution**: **Federal Non-Profit Incorporation (The $200 Fix).**

> [!CAUTION]
> **MUST be Non-Profit** to get 100% Canada Summer Jobs subsidy. For-Profit "Inc." only gets 50%.

*   **The Reality**: They are right. You should be incorporated. It protects *you* (Duane) from being sued personally if the app crashes or breaks privacy laws.
*   **The Move**:
    1.  File for a **Federal Non-Profit Corporation** online (~$200).
    2.  Name it: **"SDG Innovation Labs"** (Sound professional, not like a club).
    3.  **Bank Account**: Open a business account (RBC/TD).
    4.  **Result**: You can now legally send an Invoice to the Student Union AND get 100% CSJ wage subsidies.

> [!WARNING]
> **Arm's Length Rule**: Directors (founders) cannot be hired using CSJ/SWPP. Use subsidies to hire club members; founders get paid via AASHE contracts.

## 🗺️ The "Trojan Horse" Strategy (How to Win)

### Step 1: Join HELIX (Next Week)
*   Go to Newnham Campus, Room K2010.
*   Sign up for the "HELIX Catalyst" strand.
*   **Instant Credibility**: You are now a "Seneca Entrepreneur," not just a "Student."

### Step 2: The "Pilot" Proposal (Low Risk)
*   Don't ask the Group of Nine for $50,000.
*   Ask for a **$500 "Pilot Program"**.
*   **Say**: "We don't need a huge contract. We just need $500 to cover server costs for *one semester* to prove the data helps Seneca."
*   **Why it works**: Approving $500 is easy. Approving $5k is hard. Once you are in, you never leave.

### Step 3: The "Arm's Length" Bid
*   When they ask "How do we pay you?", say:
    > "We will follow standard procurement. We will submit a formal quote. You should get two other quotes. We will win because we are cheaper and better."

## 📝 Script: Addressing the "Group of Nine"
*(Use this exactly)*

> "I hear your concerns about funding. You are right—we need to be professional.
>
> 1.  **On Structure**: I am registering this as a **HELIX Venture**. We will be a fully incorporated entity, not a 'side project.'
> 2.  **On Value**: This isn't just for fun. This app collects specific data needed for **Seneca's AASHE STARS rating**. We are helping the college get international recognition.
> 3.  **On Risk**: We don't want a big contract yet. We want a **Micro-Pilot ($500)** to prove the data works. If we don't deliver, you stop paying."
