# 🎤 Talking Points: Club-to-Non-Profit Strategy

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Updated Language**: Say "Non-Profit Institute" not "Company/Inc." This sounds less threatening to SSF and better aligns with student values.

**Purpose**: How to explain the "USFS Club + SDG Innovation Labs (Non-Profit)" hybrid model to club members in a way that gets them excited, not defensive.

---

## 🎯 The Core Message (30-Second Pitch)

> "We love USFS. The club is staying. But right now, SSF rules mean we can't actually *pay* anyone—even if we get grants. 
>
> By launching a **non-profit institute**, we can accept real contracts, get government wage subsidies, and actually create **paid positions for club members**.
>
> **The club is our community. The non-profit is our jobs program.**"

---

## 🧠 Anticipating Their Questions

### Q1: "Are you leaving the club?"
**Answer:**
> "No. The club stays. I stay as a member. The club owns the *community*—the events, the engagement, the campus presence. That's irreplaceable.
>
> The company handles the *business* side—contracts, invoices, salaries. It's two different jobs."

---

### Q2: "Why can't we just get paid through the club?"
**Answer:**
> "SSF rules. Clubs can't have bank accounts—all money is held by SSF in trust. Every purchase needs pre-approval and receipts. And SSF can't pay a club member's personal business—that's a conflict of interest.
>
> We could keep running volunteer-only forever. Or we can structure something that lets us actually get compensated."

---

### Q3: "So who makes money—you or us?"
**Answer (Critical—address money fears head-on):**
> "**Club members** who work get paid. Period.
>
> Here's the reality: Government wage subsidies have an 'Arm's Length' rule. The founding Directors (me and 2 others) **cannot** hire ourselves initially with CSJ/SWPP.
>
> So the first round of paid positions goes to **club members, not leadership**. Canada Summer Jobs can cover 100% of minimum wage for 10 students—that's $60,000 in **real jobs for you**, not for the execs.
>
> Directors get paid later via contracts from the AASHE work—not from the subsidies meant for student employment."

---

### Q4: "What's in it for me as a club member?"
**Answer:**
> Three things:
> 1. **Co-op Placements**: We can register as a tech employer. You could do your co-op *here*, building your portfolio, with your wage partially government-funded.
> 2. **Paid Summer Work**: Canada Summer Jobs pays 100% wages. We could hire the whole exec team as "SDG Living Lab Camp Counselors."
> 3. **Resume Gold**: "Worked at a Seneca HELIX venture that secured government contracts" hits different than "Was in a sustainability club."

---

### Q5: "Are you going to profit off our volunteer work?"
**Answer (Handle with transparency):**
> "Real talk: I'm not taking the work you've already done and selling it. The club's events, the engagement, the community—that stays with the club.
>
> The company is for *new* contracts with Seneca, the Office of Sustainability, corporate sponsors. Stuff we couldn't get as 'just a club.' And anyone who works on those contracts gets paid from those contracts.
>
> If you want, I'll show you the books. Transparent funding strategy. You can see every dollar in and out."

---

### Q6: "What happens to the app?"
**Answer:**
> "The app stays connected to USFS as a partnership. USFS gets the benefits—engagement tracking, gamification, AASHE data. But the *development and maintenance* is done by the company, which can invoice for that work.
>
> Think of it like how Seneca contracts external companies to build things. We're just the 'external company' that happens to also be students."

---

## 📢 The Two Audiences: Different Approaches

### For Club **Executives** (Inner Circle)
They need the *full* picture. Be direct about the money flow.

> "Here's the structure: Club for community, Company for cash. SSF can't pay us, but Seneca Sustainability can pay the company. The company can then hire us as employees with government-subsidized wages.
>
> I'm offering you first dibs on paid positions. If you want in on the company side, let's talk. If you just want to stay on the club side, that's cool too—you'll still have all the benefits of membership."

### For General **Club Members** (Broader Community)
They need the *benefits*. Don't overwhelm with structure.

> "Hey! Big news—we're partnering with a HELIX venture to take SDG Passport to the next level. This means:
> - Potential **paid co-op placements** for members who want to build real skills
> - **Summer job opportunities** through Canada Summer Jobs
> - Direct partnerships with the Office of Sustainability
>
> The club you love isn't changing. We're just adding opportunities for those who want them."
