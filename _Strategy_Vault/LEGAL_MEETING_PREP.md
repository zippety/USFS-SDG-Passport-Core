# ⚖️ Legal Meeting Prep Guide: The "Efficiency" Protocol

**Purpose:** Use this document to brief your lawyer. Read **Part 1** verbatim to save time. Ask **Part 2** questions exactly as written to get specific answers.

---

## Part 1: The "Statement of Facts" (Read this first)

> "I am operating a hybrid social enterprise structure with three distinct entities. I need to ensure the relationships between them are compliant with CRA regulations and Ontario corporate law.
>
> **The Entities:**
> 1.  **The IP Holder:** 'Helix Agape Home' (For-Profit Corp). It owns the software/IP and seeks investor capital.
> 2.  **The Mission Vehicle:** 'SDG Labs' (Non-Profit Corp). It pursues grants and educational missions.
> 3.  **The Community Arm:** 'USFS' (Student Club). It is a club under the Seneca Student Federation used for community engagement.
>
> **The Proposed Flow:**
> *   **Ownership:** I am a director/shareholder of the For-Profit and a director of the Non-Profit.
> *   **Licensing:** The For-Profit plans to license software to the Non-Profit for **$1/year (nominal fee)** or at **cost** to aid its mission.
> *   **Operations:** The Non-Profit and Club will use the software to run events. The For-Profit benefits from the resulting user data and testing, but receives no direct payment from the Non-Profit."

---

## Part 2: The Specific Questions (Ask these exactly)

### 1. On Conflict of Interest (The "Self-Dealing" Test)
> "Since I am a director of both the For-Profit and Non-Profit, I plan to **recuse myself** from the Non-Profit's vote on any contract with the For-Profit.
> *   **Question:** Is my proposed recusal process sufficient under Ontario Non-Profit law to avoid a conflict of interest challenge?
> *   **Question:** Do I need a 'Conflict of Interest Policy' document signed by all directors now, or can we adopt it later?"

### 2. On IP & Value Transfer (The "Private Benefit" Test)
> "The For-Profit is giving value (software) to the Non-Profit for free ($1), but the For-Profit receives 'user data' and 'market validation' in return.
> *   **Question:** Could the CRA view this 'user data' as a form of payment? If so, does that create a taxable transaction I need to record?
> *   **Question:** Does the license agreement need a specific clause stating that 'improvements/modifications' made by the Non-Profit belong to the For-Profit? I want to prevent the Non-Profit from accidentally owning my IP."

### 3. On The Student Club (Liability)
> "The Student Club (USFS) is technically part of the Student Federation, not my legal entity.
> *   **Question:** If I give the software to the Club for free, and a student sues because of a data breach, does the liability sit with the Club (SSF) or my For-Profit (Agape Home)?
> *   **Question:** Should I have a separate 'Terms of Use' that individual students agree to, so they contract directly with Agape Home, bypassing the Club's legal liability?"

## Part 3: The "Red Flags" to Listen For

If the lawyer says these terms, ask for clarification immediately:

*   **"Piercing the Corporate Veil":** If you treat the money/bank accounts as the same, the law will treat the companies as the same.
    *   *Ask: "What are the strict separation rules I must follow for bank accounts?"*
*   **"Constructive Trustee":** If the Non-Profit builds a feature, the law might say they own it.
    *   *Ask: "How do I lock down IP assignment so the Non-Profit never owns the code?"*
*   **"Inurement":** If the Non-Profit pays for something that benefits you personally.
    *   *Avoid:* Never let the Non-Profit pay for your travel if you are pitching your For-Profit.

## Part 4: Documents to Bring (Checklist)

*   [ ] **Draft License Agreement** (The simple 1-page "Agape grants SDG Labs right to use software for $1").
*   [ ] **Corporate Organization Chart** (Drawing showing You -> Agape (100%) and You -> SDG Labs (Director)).
*   [ ] **Bylaws of SDG Labs** (If you have them).
*   [ ] **SSF Club Policy** (Print the Seneca website page listing club rules).

**Closing Tip:** Tell them: *"I want to set this up correctly now so I am 'Due Diligence Ready' for investors in 6 months."*
