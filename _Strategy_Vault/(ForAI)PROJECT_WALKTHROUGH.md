# Walkthrough: USFS SDG Passport (Phase 1 Bootstrap)

**For the USFS Leadership Team & SenecaAI Partners.**
This document outlines the current state of the "Living Lab" platform. We have moved from *Theory* to *Product*.

## 1. The Strategy (The "Why")
*   **The Pivot**: Transforming from a "Club" to a "Venture Studio".
*   **The Vision**: [SDG_Vision_Bootstrap_Phase1.md](SDG_Vision_Bootstrap_Phase1.md)
    *   *Core Concept*: **"The Trojan Horse."** We build a high-fidelity frontend (Phase 1) to prove demand and unlock the funding for the backend (Phase 2).
*   **The Plan**: [SIMPLIFIED_ACTION_PLAN.md](SIMPLIFIED_ACTION_PLAN.md)
    *   *Focus*: "Mega Bonk" Marketing (Hype) & Operational Alignment.

## 2. The Product (The "What")
The App is currently LIVE (Localhost MVP) with the following features:
*   **SDG Passport**: Digital stamp collection for all 17 Goals.
*   **Sustainability Pet**: ("Eco-Companion") An interactive mascot to drive student engagement.
*   **Events Calendar**: (`/events`) A booking system for workshops and volunteering.
*   **Community Hub**: (`/community`) A Slack-like chat interface to replace WhatsApp.
*   **Team Command Center**: (`/team`) Internal dashboard for Exec alignment (Strategy, Roles, Kanban).

## 3. The Visual Identity (The "Vibe")
*   **Visual Prompts**: [Visual_Prompts_for_USFS.md](Visual_Prompts_for_USFS.md)
    *   *Aesthetic*: Clean, Dark Mode, Gamified, "Living Lab" Digital City.

## 4. The "Deep Dive" (The Demo)
*   **The Script**: `/.agent/workflows/demo_video_script.md` (Use this to film the "Zero to App" video).
*   **The Code**: Run `npm run dev` to launch the platform.

## 5. The Ask (Phase 2)
We are pitching this platform to SenecaAI to secure:
1.  **Cloud Infrastructure** (Firebase) for real-time Chat/Pet logic.
2.  **App Store Funding** to deploy to iOS/Android.
