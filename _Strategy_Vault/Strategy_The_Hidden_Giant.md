# THE "HIDDEN GIANT" STRATEGY: Media Brand First
**The "Mega Bonk" Model for Social Impact**
**Verified Insight:** Content is the Product. The Product is the Content.

---

## 1. THE PARADIGM SHIFT
We are no longer building a "SaaS App." We are building a **Media Brand** (*DJ the Creative Director*) that happens to be building an app.

| Old Model (Product First) | New Model (Media First) |
| :--- | :--- |
| Build MVP in silence | Build MVP on TikTok |
| Beg for users | Users beg for features |
| Zero revenue until launch | Revenue from Day 1 (Content/Courses) |
| "Please fund me, Seneca" | "We have 50k followers, Seneca." |

## 2. THE REVENUE STACK (How We Fund Phase 2)
The app doesn't need to make money yet. **YOU** make money to fund the app.

1.  **SSF Student-Led Initiative (The Catalyst)**
    *   **Grant:** Up to $5,000.
    *   **Project:** "SDG Passport Community Build Series" (12 Weeks).
    *   **Apply:** Mid-January 2025.
2.  **Content Creator Fund**
    *   **TikTok/YouTube:** 1M views = ~$40. (Low, but builds momentum).
    *   **Brand Deals:** "Sponsored by [GreenTech Co]" ($500/video).
3.  **Digital Products**
    *   **Course:** "How I built a Social Impact App (No-Code)" ($49).
    *   **Consulting:** Helping other Seneca clubs build their apps ($500/project).

## 3. THE 7-DAY CONTENT ROADMAP ("Build in Public")
**Goal:** 10k Views + 100 Signups for USFS.

### **Video 1: The Hook ("I'm Building It")**
*   **Visual:** Selfie style + Screen recording of Figma.
*   **Script:** "I'm a student at Seneca, and I'm tired of boring sustainability reports. So I'm building this: The SDG Passport. But I need YOUR help. What feature should I build first? Most liked comment wins."
*   **CTA:** "Comment below + Follow to see me build it."

### **Video 2: The Proof ("I Listened")**
*   **Visual:** Timelapse of you coding/designing the "Sustainability Pet".
*   **Script:** "You voted for a Pet, so I built... THIS. Meet 'Eco-Bot'. But he looks hungry. What should he eat? Plastic waste? CO2? Vote now."
*   **CTA:** "Join USFS (Link in bio) to beta test him."

### **Video 3: The Hype ("It's Alive")**
*   **Visual:** Reaction video of a USFS member trying the app.
*   **Script:** "I let the Sustainability Club try the prototype. Here's what happened..." (Show them laughing/excited).
*   **CTA:** "Want early access? Link in bio."
