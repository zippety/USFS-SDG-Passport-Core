# ⚔️ Enactus Meeting Strategy: The "Powered By" Protocol

**Objective:** Secure Enactus resources (Volunteers + Funding) without losing IP ownership.

---

## 🎯 The Deal Structure
**Context:** Enactus Seneca needs a "Winning Project" for Regionals/Nationals. They don't have time to build tech; they need something "shovel-ready" that generates impact metrics immediately.

*   **What Enactus Wants:**
    *   **Metrics:** Cups saved, Cafes signed, Students engaged (to win trophies).
    *   **The Narrative:** "Enactus Seneca students flagged 50 cafes and saved 10k cups."
*   **What We Want:**
    *   **Sales Force:** 20+ student volunteers to canvas cafes (free labor).
    *   **Funding:** Access to Enactus-exclusive grants (Scotiabank Climate Challenge, TD Entrepreneurship).
    *   **Campus Access:** Official "Enactus Partner" status opens doors with Admin.

## 🛡️ The "Powered By" Protection Clause
**The Trap:** "Founder's Trap." Enactus often absorbs projects, and when the founder graduates, the project stays with the school.
**The Fix:** Structure this as a **Strategic Partnership**, not a "Student Club Project."

**The Phrasing:**
> *"Responsible Cafes TO is a student-led initiative **powered by the SDG Passport technology platform**."*

**The Operational Rule:**
1.  **IP Ownership:** The App, the Database, and the "SDG Passport" brand remain 100% owned by **Agape Home Inc. / SDG Labs**.
2.  **Data License:** We grant Enactus Seneca a license to *use* the data for their competition presentations. They do not *own* the user data.
3.  **Vendor Relationship:** Ideally, Enactus "hires" SDG Labs (even for $1) to provide the tech. This legally separates the entity from the club.

## 🎭 Roles for the Meeting
*   **Keithan (The Visionary Founder):**
    *   **Vibe:** Passionate, community-focused, "Boots on the ground."
    *   ** Talking Points:** "I have cafes ready to sign. I have the passion. I need a team to scale this city-wide."
*   **Duane (The Strategic Partner / CTO):**
    *   **Vibe:** Professional, structural, "The Adult in the Room."
    *   **Talking Points:** "The infrastructure is built. The app tracks the impact metrics automatically. We are ensuring this project is data-compliant and scalable beyond just one semester."

## 🤝 The USFS Club Position: "The Innovation Lab"
**Question:** Why partner? Why not just do this as USFS?
**Answer:** Scale.
*   **USFS Club is the "Lab":** We build the tech, test the pilots (Living Labs), and own the IP. We are the "Product Team."
*   **Enactus is the "Sales Force":** They have the manpower (General Members) and the platform (Competitions) to scale the impact.
*   **The Narrative:** "USFS innovates; Enactus scales." This keeps you in the "Expert/Founder" seat and lets them do the heavy lifting of canvassing cafes.

## 📧 Application: The Email Reply
**Goal:** Establish Duane as a key stakeholder immediately so they know this isn't just a "solo student project."
