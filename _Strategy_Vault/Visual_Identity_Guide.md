# 🎨 Visual Identity Guide: The "Smart Campus" Brand
**Aesthetic Code**: `Professional` | `Institutional` | `Command Center`

---

## 🌟 The Vibe: "The Command Center"
Our visual language is **Operational Excellence**. We are moving away from abstract "gamification" and towards a "Smart Campus Operations Tool." The interface should feel like a high-end dashboard used by Directors and Executives.

### The Core Feeling
*   **Professional**: Clean lines, high contrast, readable data.
*   **Operational**: Focus on metrics, dates, and actionable items.
*   **Institutional**: Aligned perfectly with the **United Seneca for Sustainability (USFS)** brand.

## 🎨 The Color Palette
*We use the official United Seneca for Sustainability audit-proof colors.*

### Primary Brand Colors
*   � **Seneca Red**: `#DA291C` (High visibility, Alerts, Primary Actions)
*   � **USFS Green**: `#006838` (Sustainability, Success, Growth)
*   � **USFS Teal**: `#009FA1` (Innovation, Accents, Secondary Buttons)

### SDG Color System
*We respect the official UN Sustainable Development Goals color codes for data categorization.*
*   SDG 13 (Climate): `#3F7E44`
*   SDG 4 (Education): `#C5192D`
*   *(And all standard 17 SDG colors)*

## 💎 Design Elements

### 1. The "Card" Structure (Dashboard Style)
*   **Rule**: Information is organized in clean, white cards with soft shadows (`shadow-md`).
*   **Meaning**: Order and Clarity.
*   **Usage**: Task lists, metrics, event details.

### 2. Typography (The Voice)
*   **Primary Font**: **Inter** (Google Fonts).
*   **Why**: It is the standard for modern, legible user interfaces. It looks clean at small sizes (mobile) and professional at large sizes (presentations).
*   **Weights**: Heavy use of **Bold (700)** for numbers and headers; **Regular (400)** for body text.

### 3. Iconography
*   **Library**: **Lucide React**.
*   **Style**: Simple, outlined, crisp icons. No cartoons.
*   **Usage**: Navigation, Action Buttons, Metric labels.

## 🖼️ User & Graphic Assets

### The Mascot: "Sprout"
*   **Visual**: A pixel-art or simple vector style growing plant.
*   **Role**: A friendly, subtle companion that grows as the student engaged.
*   **Accessory**: Wears a **Seneca Red Scarf** to show school spirit.

### Avatars
*   **Style**: Real photography.
*   **Usage**: Team members and Leadership.
*   **Why**: "Real people doing real work." (Replaced the cartoon avatars).

---

## 🗣️ The "Voice" of the Interface
*   **Tone**: Direct, Empowering, Institutional.
*   **Do**: "Action Required", "Impact Verified", "Phase 1 Complete".
*   **Don't**: "Hey dude!", "Check this out!", "Zap!" (Avoid slang).
