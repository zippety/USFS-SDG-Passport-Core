## � Chapter 2: The Global Economic Environment
*Theory:* Supply & Demand, Business Cycles, The "Gig Economy."
*   **The Agape Application:**
    *   **The Trend:** The shift from "Jobs" to "Gigs" is your friend.
    *   **Your Strategy:** You are leveraging the **Gig Economy** for students. The SDG Passport prepares them for a project-based world, not a 9-to-5 world.
    *   **The Pitch:** "We don't just teach students sustainability; we teach them to be *Sustainability Contractors* for the new economy."

## � Chapter 3: The Global Marketplace
*Theory:* Exporting, Licensing, Franchising.
*   **The Agape Application:**
    *   **The Insight:** You are not a local club; you are a global exporter.
    *   **Your Strategy:** **Licensing** is your scaling model. You are not building 100 campuses; you are *licensing* your IP (The Passport) to them.
    *   **The Tech:** The "SDG" language is the global standard (ISO). By generating UN-compliant data, your product is instantly exportable to any university in the world.

## ⚖️ Chapter 4: Ethics & Social Responsibility
*   **Strategy:** **SDG Labs** is your "Chief Ethics Office," certifying that your For-Profit's revenue is mission-aligned. You don't *do* CSR; you *sell* CSR infrastructure.

## 🏢 Chapter 5: Forms of Ownership
*   **Strategy:** Your **Tri-Entity Hybrid** (Club + Non-Profit + Corp) is the advanced defense against liability and the ultimate tax-optimization vehicle.

## 🚀 Chapter 6: Entrepreneurship
*   **Strategy:** You are an **"Ecosystem Intrapreneur"**—selling innovation to Seneca from the outside, solving their AASHE problems better than they can internally.

## � Chapter 7: Management & Leadership
*Theory:* Vision, Mission, Goals, SWOT Analysis.
*   **The Agape Application:**
    *   **Your Role:** You are the **Visionary Leader** (Keeper of the Flame).
    *   **Action:** Your job is not to write code; it is to strictly enforce the *Vision* (The Narrative) across all three entities so they don't drift.
    *   **SWOT:**
        *   *Strength:* Speed, Tech.
        *   *Weakness:* Cash flow.
        *   *Opportunity:* Corporate CSR budgets.
        *   *Threat:* Bureaucracy/Audit (hence your strict Compliance Strategy).

## �️ Chapter 8: Organizational Structure
*Theory:* Hierarchies, Matrix Orgs, Networked Organizations.
*   **The Agape Application:**
    *   **Old Way:** Top-Down Hierarchy (Dean -> Prof -> Student).
    *   **Your Way:** **Networked Organization**.
    *   **The Structure:** You actively blur the lines between "Staff," "Volunteer," and "User." A student can be a user today, a volunteer tomorrow, and a paid contractor next month using the CSJ grant. This flexibility is your superpower.

## 🤝 Chapter 10: Human Resource Management
*Theory:* Hiring, Training, Compensation.
*   **The Agape Application:**
    *   **The Challenge:** You can't pay market rates.
    *   **The Fix:** **"Intrinsic Compensation."** You pay in *Purpose* and *Portfolio*.
    *   **The Pitch:** "Come work for Google, you're a cog. Come work for SDG Labs, you're a 'Lead Engineer' saving the planet." You attract talent looking for meaning, which is cheaper and more loyal than talent looking for money.

## � Chapter 12: Motivating Employees
*Theory:* Maslow’s Hierarchy, Intrinsic vs. Extrinsic reward.
*   **The Agape Application:**
    *   **The Insight:** Grades (Extrinsic) are a weak motivator. Impact (Intrinsic) is infinite.
    *   **Your Strategy:** The **Hackathon Model**. You create "Time-Boxed Intensity" events where teams self-manage to achieve a high-glory goal (winning the Space Prize). This requires zero "management" from you because they are self-motivated by the mission.

## 📣 Chapter 14: Marketing (The Product Mix)
*   **Strategy:** Shift from B2C (Students / Free) to B2B (Corporations / Talent Pipeline). Your product is the **Access to Talent**.

## 💰 Chapter 18: Financial Management
*   **Strategy:** "Cash Flow > Profit." Use the **Indirect Payment Protocol** (Grants -> Vendor) to manage cash flow without violating non-profit rules.

---

## 🛡️ Special Topic: Risk Management
*Theory:* Identifying, Assessing, and Mitigating business risks (Market, Financial, Legal).
*   **The Agape Application:**
    *   **The Big Risk:** **"Founder Dependency"** (If you get sick, the project dies) and **"Audit Risk"** (CRA compliance).
    *   **The Mitigation:** 
        1.  **Documentation:** This "Strategy Vault" is your risk mitigation. By writing everything down, you transfer IP from your brain to the company.
        2.  **Compliance:** The "Safe Harbor" tax strategy is essentially a Risk Management protocol.
    *   **Action:** Treat your legal/accounting fees not as "expenses" but as "insurance premiums" against the death of the company.
