# 🔍 Research Validation: Gap Analysis & Final Recommendation

## 🚨 CRITICAL GAP #1: CSJ 2025 Deadline MISSED

**Finding:** The Canada Summer Jobs 2025 employer application deadline was **December 19, 2024**.

| Date | What |
|------|------|
| ❌ Dec 19, 2024 | CSJ 2025 application deadline (PASSED) |
| Apr 21, 2025 | Earliest job start date |
| Aug 30, 2025 | Latest job end date |

**Impact:** You cannot access CSJ funding for Summer 2025 unless:
1. You apply for a late exception (unlikely to succeed)
2. You wait and apply for **CSJ 2026** (deadline likely Dec 2025)

**Mitigation:** Focus on SWPP and HELIX for Year 1 instead.

## 🚨 CRITICAL GAP #2: Soliciting Corporation Classification

**Finding:** Once you receive >$10,000 in "public sources" (including government grants), you become a **Soliciting Corporation** under CNCA with stricter requirements:

| Requirement | Non-Soliciting (<$10k grants) | Soliciting (>$10k grants) |
|-------------|------------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Minimum Directors** | 1 | 3 (2 must be independent) |
| **Financial Audit** | Review engagement (optional if <$50k) | Mandatory audit if >$250k/year |
| **File Financials Publicly** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes - publicly available |
| **Asset Lock on Dissolution** | Flexible distribution | Must go to "qualified donee" |

**Impact:** If you receive CSJ ($60k) + SWPP ($37k) + HELIX ($5k), you're immediately Soliciting.

**Action Needed:** Plan for 3 Directors (2 independent) from Day 1.

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL GAP #3: D&O Insurance Required

**Finding:** Directors & Officers liability insurance is effectively mandatory for Canadian non-profits:

- Directors can be **personally liable** for unpaid taxes, payroll remittances, wages
- Minimum recommended coverage: **$2 million**
- Small non-profits: $1-2M coverage typically costs $500-$2,000/year

**Action Needed:** Add to Year 1 budget: ~$1,000-$2,000 for D&O insurance.

---

## ⚠️ GAP #4: SWPP Ontario Waitlist

**Finding:** TECHNATION Career Ready Program (SWPP) for Summer 2025 is currently on **WAITLIST** for Ontario placements.

**Impact:** May not get SWPP funding immediately for Summer 2025.

**Mitigation:** 
- Apply for Fall 2025 SWPP now (accepting applications)
- Apply for Winter 2026 SWPP now (accepting applications)

---

## ⚠️ GAP #5: CRA Payroll Account Required

**Finding:** Before hiring anyone with CSJ/SWPP, you need:
1. CRA Business Number
2. **CRA Payroll Deductions Program Account (RP)**

**Action Needed:** Register for RP account immediately after incorporation.

---

## ⚠️ GAP #6: TechSoup Canada Access

- Microsoft 365 Nonprofit (free)
- Various productivity and development tools

**Action Needed:** Register at techsoup.ca after incorporation.
