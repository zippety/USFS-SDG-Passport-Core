# SDG Passport Project Rules 🌍

## Rule 1: The "Impact First" Code Style
*   **Variable Naming**: Use clear, descriptive names. (e.g., `calculateImpactScore` not `calcScore`).
*   **Why**: Our code is our "Transparent Engine." It must be readable by future students.

## Rule 2: Efficiency (Solarpunk Standard) ⚡
*   **Performance**: Optimize for low-bandwidth devices. Many students use older phones.
*   **Images**: Always use optimized WebP/SVG formats.

## Rule 3: Component Reuse (The "Lego" System) 🧱
*   **Reuse**: If you build a "Badge Card," make it a reusable component.
*   **Refactor**: Don't copy-paste UI. Build a library.

## Rule 4: Windows Environment 🪟
*   **Commands**: Expect Windows/PowerShell (Use `Ctrl` not `Cmd`).

## Rule 5: Documentation is Currency 📝
*   **README**: Every new feature needs a line in the README.
*   **Comments**: Explain *Why* not just *What*. (e.g., "// Using LocalStorage for MVP to avoid server costs").

## Rule 6: No "Dead Code" (Leave it Cleaner) 🧹
*   **Cleanup**: Delete unused files immediately. We don't hoard trash.
